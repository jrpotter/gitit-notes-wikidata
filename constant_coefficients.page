When handling second order differential equations, it is often easier to consider a less generalized version of the equations
where coefficients are constant, rather than functions. That is, we consider equations of the form $$ ay'' + by' + cy = 0. $$ 
Then the **characteristic equation** of a second order linear homogeneous differential equation is
$$ ar^2 + br + c = 0. $$
If $r$ is a root of the given polynomial equation, then we note $y = e^{rt}$ is a solution of the differential equation.
Note this equation may have two real roots, one real root repeated, or complex conjugates.

<div class="proof">

Consider the differential equation
$$ ay'' + by' + cy = 0, $$
whose coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ are arbitrary real constants. Suppose a solution in an exponential form exists
such that $y = e^{rt}$, where $r$ is a parameter to be determined. Then it follows that $y' = re^{rt}$ and $y'' = r^2e^{rt}$.
By substituting into the original equation, we find that $$ (ar^2 + br + c)e^{rt} = 0 $$
and, since $e^{rt} \neq 0$ for all $t$, then we have $$ ar^2 + br + c = 0. $$
If we assume the roots are real and different, denoted by $r_1$ and $r_2$, then $y_1(t) = e^{r_1t}$ and
$y_2(t) = e^{r_2}t$ are two solutions. Therefore
$$ y = c_1y_1(t) + c_2y_2(t) = c_1e^{r_1t} + c_2e^{r_2t} $$
is also a solution, which is easily verified by differentiating and substituting.

# Complex Roots

<div class="block">

![Complex Rooted Solution](/img/graphs/diffeq/sample-complex-roots-solution.png)

Suppose the roots of the characteristic equation are complex numbers $\lambda \pm i\mu$. Then, the pair of real valued
solutions $$ u(t) = e^{\lambda t}\cos{\mu t} \text { and } v(t) = e^{\lambda t}\sin{\mu t} $$
form a [fundamental set of solutions](wronskian#fundamental-set-of-solutions) so long as $\mu \neq 0$.

</div>

<div class="proof">

Consider second order equation $$ L[y] = ay'' + by' + cy = 0, $$ and suppose the roots of the characteristic equation
are conjugate complex numbers (formed when the discriminant of the quadratic equation is less than $0$). Then our
solutions are $$ y_1(t) = \exp[(\lambda + i\mu)t] \text{ and } y_2(t) = \exp[(\lambda - i\mu)t]. $$
So, by [Euler's Formula](eulers_number#eulers-formula), 
$$\begin{align*}
  y_1(t) &= e^{(\lambda + i\mu)t}                                 \\
         &= e^{\lambda t}(cos{\mu t} + i\sin{\mu t})              \\
         &= e^{\lambda t}\cos{\mu t} + ie^{\lambda t}\sin{\mu t}.
\end{align*}$$
Similarly, $y_2(t) = e^{\lambda t}\cos{\mu t} - ie^{\lambda t}\sin{\mu t}$. Now by the 
[principle of superposition](homogeneous_equations#principle-of-superposition), we note that $y_1 + y_2$ and $y_1 - y_2$
must also be solutions. Therefore
$$\begin{align*}
  y_1(t) + y_2(t) &= e^{\lambda t}(\cos{\mu t} + i\sin{\mu t}) + e^{\lambda t}(\cos{\mu t} - i\sin{\mu t}) \\
                  &= 2e^{\lambda t}\cos{\mu t}
\end{align*}$$
and
$$\begin{align*}
  y_1(t) - y_2(t) &= e^{\lambda t}(\cos{\mu t} + i\sin{\mu t}) - e^{\lambda t}(\cos{\mu t} - i\sin{\mu t}) \\
                  &= 2ie^{\lambda t}\sin{\mu t}
\end{align*}$$
are also solutions. By neglecting the constant multipliers, we then have our pair of real-valued solutions:
$$ u(t) = e^{\lambda t}\cos{\mu t} \text { and } v(t) = e^{\lambda t}\sin{\mu t}. $$ The [Wronskian](wronskian)
of these solutions is $$ W(u, v)(t) = \mu e^{2\lambda t}, $$ meaning as long as $\mu \neq 0$, $u$ and $v$ form a fundamental
set of solutions.

# Repeated Roots

The third possible case arises when the discriminant of the characteristic equation is $0$. In this case, the roots
$r_1$ and $r_2$ are the same, and we use D'Alembert's method to come up with the general solution. In particular,
this solution is $$ y = c_1e^{-bt/2a} + c_2te^{-bt/2a}, $$ where $a$ and $b$ are the corresponding constants in
the characteristic equation.

<div class="proof">

Note that the characteristic equation has repeated roots so $r_1 = r_2 = -b/2a$ since $b^2 - 4ac = 0$. Therefore one 
solution of $$ L[y] = ay'' + by' + cy = 0 $$ is $$ y_1(t) = e^{-bt/2a}. $$ To find a second solution, assume that 
$$ y = v(t)y_1(t) = v(t)e^{-bt/2a}. $$ Then $$ y' = v'(t)e^{-bt/2a} - \frac{b}{2a}v(t)e^{-bt/2a} $$ and
$$ y'' = v''(t)e^{-bt/2a} - \frac{b}{a}v'(t)e^{-bt/2a} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}v(t)e^{-bt/2a}. $$
Therefore, substituting in $L[y]$, we get that
$$ 
  \left\{a\left[v''(t) - \frac{b}{a}v'(t) + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}v(t)\right] + 
         b\left[v'(t) - \frac{b}{2a}v(t)\right] + cv(t) 
  \right\}e^{-bt/2a} = 0. 
$$
Simplifying further, and noting that the discriminant is zero by hypothesis, we see that 
$$\begin{align*}
  av''(t) + (-b + b)v'(t) + \left(\frac{b^2}{4a} - \frac{b^2}{2a} + c\right)v(t) &= 0 \\
  av''(t) + \left(\frac{-b^2}{4a} + c\right)v(t) &= 0                                 \\
  av''(t) &= 0                                                                        \\
  v''(t) &= 0.
\end{align*}$$

Thus, by integration, $v(t) = c_1 + c_2t$, and we get that $$ y = c_1e^{-bt/2a} + c_2te^{-bt/2a}. $$
As an aside, we note that $$ W(y_1, y_2)(t) = e^{-bt/a} $$ where
$$ y_1(t) = e^{-bt/2a} \;\text{ and }\; y_2(t) = te^{-bt/2a} $$ which is nonzero everywhere, meaning the
two solutions indeed form a [fundamental set of solutions](wronskian#fundamental-set-of-solutions).
