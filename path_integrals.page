Path integrals are a generalization of the traditional integral applied over some parameterized curve $C$ instead of an interval 
$[a, b]$. In particular, rather than dividing up an interval into $n$ equal subintervals, we instead divide up the parameter
interval, yielding $n$ subintervals along the actual curve. If evaluating with respect to arc length, we can evaluate the integral
at a given point within each subinterval, and multiply it by the length of the function. Summing up over arbitrarily many 
subintervals yields an approximation over the curve in much the same manner as a traditional integral. 

More precisely, if $\;f$ is a function defined on a smooth curve $C$ given by $x = x(t)$, $y = y(t)$ for $a \leq t \leq b$,
then the **path integral of $\;f$ along $C$** is
$$ \int_C \;f(x, y)\;ds = \xlimit{n}{\infty} \sum_{i=1}^n \;f(x_i^*, y_i^*) \Delta{s_i} $$
if this limit exists.

# Path Integrals In Space

Suppose that $C$ is a smooth space curve given by the parametric equations
$$ x = x(t), \quad y = y(t), \quad z = z(t) \quad a \leq t \leq b $$
or by a vector equation $\pmb{r}(t) = s(t)\pmb{i} + y(t)\pmb{j} + z(t)\pmb{k}$. If $f$ is a function of three variables
that is continuous on some region containing $C$, then we define the **path integral of $f$ along $C$** (with respect
to arc length) in a manner similar to that for plane curves:
$$ \int_C \;f(x, y, z)\;ds = \xlimit{n}{\infty} \sum_{i=1}^n \;f(x_i^*, y_i^*, z_i^*) \Delta{s_i} $$

which can be evaluated as
$$ 
  \int_C \;f(x, y, z)\;ds = \int_a^b \;f(x(t), y(t), z(t)) \sqrt{
    \left(\leibniz[x]{t}\right)^2 + \left(\leibniz[y]{t}\right)^2 + \left(\leibniz[z]{t}\right)^2}\;dt
    = \int_a^b \pmb{F}(\pmb{r}(t)) \cdot \pmb{r}'(t)\;dt.
$$
