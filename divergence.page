In a vector field, we can view divergence as the ratio of particles that *flow* in and out of a given point. 
That is, if the collective components of magnitude of vectors that point towards a specific point is greater than
those that point away from the point, we'd expect over time for this given point to get denser, so to speak. In
this case we have a negative divergence, since particles tend to converge. If the collective magnitude of the
vectors are overall outward, then we expect the point to get less and less dense since, over time, the points seem
to *diverge* away from the given point. If the divergence of a vector field is $0$, we say the vector field is
**incompressible** (which makes sense, since no points move anywhere).

More precisely, if $\pmb{F} = P\pmb{i} + Q\pmb{j} + R\pmb{k}$ is a vector field on $\bbr^3$ whose components
have partial derivatives that exist, then the **divergence of $\pmb{F}$** is the function of three variables
defined by
$$ \text{div}\;\pmb{F} = \pleibniz[P]{x} + \pleibniz[Q]{y} + \pleibniz[R]{z}. $$
