# Birthday Problem

<div class="block">

![Birthday Problem](/img/graphs/statistics/birthday_problem.png)

In a group of $n$ people, we want to determine the probability in which two of them share the same birthday. 
In particular, we find that if $n \geq 23$, the probability is greater than $\frac{1}{2}$.

</div>

<div class="proof">

Suppose $n$ people are present in a room; as each person can celebrate his birthday on any one of $365$ days,
there is a total of $(365)^n$ possible outcomes. For no two of them to share the same birthday constitutes
probability
$$ \frac{(365)(364)\cdots(365-n+1)}{(365)^n}. $$

From the above chart, we see that at $n \geq 23$, the probability is greater than $\frac{1}{2}$.

# Matching Problem

<div class="block">

![Matching Problem](/img/graphs/statistics/matching-problem.png)

Suppose that each of $N$ men at a party throws his hat into the center of the room. The hats are first mixed up,
and then each man randomly selects a hat. The probability that none of the men selects his own hat is:

$$ e^{-1} \approx .36788 $$

</div>

<div class="proof">

First we calculate the complementary problem of at least one man selecting his own hat. Let us denote
$E_i, i = 1, 2, \ldots, N$ as the event that the $\spscript{i}{th}$ man selects his own hat. By the
[Inclusion/Exclusion Principle](CB/inclusion_exclusion_principle), we see that:
$$ 
  \bbps{\bigcup_{i=1}^N E_i} = \sum_{i=1}^N \bbps{E_i} - \sum_{i_1 < i_2} \bbps{E_{i_1}E_{i_2}} + \cdots
                             + (-1)^{n+1} \sum_{\inflate[<]{i}{n}} \bbps{E_{i_1}E_{i_2}\cdots E_{i_n}}
                             + \cdots + (-1)^{N+1}\bbps{\inflate[]{E}{N}}.
$$
If we regard the outcome of this experiment as a vector of $N$ numbers, where the $\spscript{i}{th}$ element
is the number of the hat drawn by the $\spscript{i}{th}$ man, then there are $N!$ possible outcomes. 

Furthermore, $E_{i_1}E_{i_2}\ldots E_{i_n}$, the event that each of the $n$ men $\inflate{i}{n}$ selects his 
own hat, can occur in any of $(N-n)(N-n-1)\cdots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = (N-n)!$ possible ways; for, of the remaining 
$N-n$ men, the first can select any of $N-n$ hats, the second can select any of $N - n - 1$ hats, etc.
Assuming that all $N!$ possible outcomes are equally likely, we see that
$$ \bbps{E_{i_1}E_{i_2}\cdots E_{i_n}} = \frac{(N-n)!}{N!}. $$

Also, as there are $\binom{N}{n}$ terms in $\sum_{\inflate[<]{i}{n}}\bbps{E_{i_1}E_{i_2}\ldots E_{i_n}}$, it follows
that
$$
  \sum_{\inflate[<]{i}{n}} \bbps{E_{i_1}E_{i_2}\ldots E_{i_n}} = \frac{N!(N-n)!}{(N-n)!n!N!} = \frac{1}{n!}.
$$
Thus,
$$
  \bbps{\bigcup_{i=1}^N E_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} - \cdots + (-1)^{N+1}\frac{1}{N!}.
$$
Hence, the probability that none of the men selects his own hat is
$$ 1 - 1 + \frac{1}{2!} - \frac{1}{3!} + \cdots + (-1)^{N}\frac{1}{N!}, $$
which is approximately $e^{-1} \approx .36788$ for $N$ large.
