![Cycle of Length Three](/img/diagrams/abstract/cycle.png)

Let $\sigma$ be a permutation of a set $A$. The equivalence classes in $A$ determined by the equivalence relation
$$ \text{For } a, b \in A, \text{ let } a ~ b \text{ if and only if } b = \sigma^n(a) \text{ for some } n \in \bbz $$
are called the **orbits of $\sigma$**. A permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ is a **cycle** if it has at most one orbit 
containing more than one element. The **length** of a cycle is the number of elements in its largest orbit.
We provide cyclic notation for convenience's sake. For instance, 
$$ \mu = (1, 3, 6), $$
which represents the cycle displayed to the right, takes each number to the next element, cycling around to the
first element if at the end. An integer not appearing in the notation is understood to map to itself (these are
the other orbits containing just one element).

<div class="proof">

We need to show that $\text{~}$ as described above is indeed an equivalence relation. In the following, let
$a, b, c \in A$.

- *Symmetric:* $a \text{ ~ } a$ since $a = \sigma^0(a)$.

- *Reflexive:* Suppose $a \text{ ~ } b$. Then $b = \sigma^n(a)$ for some $n \in \bbz$. But then
               $a = \sigma^{-n}(b)$ and $-n \in \bbz$, so $b \text{ ~ } a$.

- *Transitive:* Suppose $a \text{ ~ } b$ and $b \text{ ~ } c$. Then $b = \sigma^n(a)$ and $c = \sigma^m(b)$ for some 
                $n, m \in \bbz$. Substituting, we find that $c = \sigma^m(\sigma^n(a)) = \sigma^{n+m}(a)$, so $a \text{ ~ } c$.

# Disjointedness

Every permutation $\sigma$ of a finite set is a product of disjoint cycles. As an aside, note that the product of
disjoint cycles are commutative, and, since orbits are unique, the representation of a permutation as these disjoint
cycles must also be unique up to the order of the factors.

<div class="proof">

Let $\inflate{B}{r}$ be the orbits of $\sigma$, and let $\mu_i$ be the cycle defined by
$$ \mu_i(x) = \begin{cases} \sigma(x) &\text{for } x \in B_i \\ x &\text{otherwise}. \end{cases} $$
Then $\sigma = \inflatec[]{\mu}{r}$, since elements in one orbit cannot be in another and by construction
each $\mu_i$ is disjoint from the others. That is, the equivalence-class orbits $\inflate{B}{r}$ are disjoint,
then the cycles $\inflate{\mu}{r}$ must be as well.

# Transpositions

A cycle of length $2$ is a **transposition**. We note that a transposition leaves all elements but two fixed,
and maps each of these onto the other. We also see that any cycle is a product of transpositions since
$$ (\inflate{a}{n}) = (a_1, a_n)(a_1, a_{n-1})\cdots(a_1, a_3)(a_1, a_2). $$
We also note that, though a representation of a permutation as some number of transpositions is not unique,
the parity of the number of transpositions must always be the same. That is, no permutation in $S_n$ can
be expressed both as a product of an even number and an odd number of transpositions.

<div class="proof">

Consider the isomorphism between the numbers $1, 2, \ldots, n$ and the $n$ rows of the $n \times n$ identity
matrix $I_n$. Additionally, note that the identity matrix has [determinant](determinant) $1$ and that interchanging 
any two rows of a square matrix changes the sign of the determinant (i.e. the number of inversions of a given pattern
is changed by $1$). If $C$ could be obtained from $I_n$ by both an even number and an odd number of transpositions
of rows, its determinant would have to be both $1$ and $-1$, which is impossible. Thus $\sigma$ cannot be expressed
as a product of both an even and an odd number of transpositions.
