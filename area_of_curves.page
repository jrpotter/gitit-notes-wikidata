![Area Under Curve](/img/graphs/calculus/area-under-curve.png)

The **area** $A$ of the region $S$ that lies under the graph of the continuous function $f$ is the limit of
the sum of the areas of the approximating rectangles $$A = \xlimit{n}{\infty}R_n = \xlimit{n}{\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n
f(x_i)\Delta x$$.

# Area Formula

The area formula can be generalized for plane curves.

<section class="secondary">

## Cartesian Curves

We note in this case, area can be interpreted geometrically as the space between the $x$-axis and a curve above the 
$x$-axis, with "negative" areas occurring for space between the $x$-axis and the curve below the $x$-axis. This is
exactly the integral from $a$ to $b$:

$$\int_a^bf(x)dx = \xlimit{n}{\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^{*})\Delta x.$$

## Parametric Curves

Let $x = f(t)$ and $y = g(t)$ such that the conditions for [conversion](#to-cartesian-coordinates) are satisfied 
(in a piecewise manner if necessary). The area under this curve is
$$ A = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} g(t)f'(t)\text{ or } \int_{\beta}^{\alpha} g(t)f'(t)dt\text{.} $$

<div class="proof"> 
Note $y = F(x)$ can be written as $ g(t) = F(f(t)) $ and so, if $f, F,$ and $f$ are differentiable,
the Chain Rule gives
$$ A = \int_a^b ydx = \left[ \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} g(t)f'(t)dt \text{ or } \int_{\beta}^{\alpha} g(t)f'(t)dt \right] $$
where the limits of integration are found also with the [Substitution Rule](integration_techniques#substitution-rule)
(when $x = a$, $t$ is either $\alpha$ or $\beta$ and when $x = b$, $t$ is the remaining value).

## Polar Curves

Let $R$ be the region bounded by the polar curve $r = f(\theta)$ and by the rays $\theta = a$ and $\theta = b$, where $f$ is a
positive continuous function and where $0 < b - a \leq 2\pi$. Then the area $A$ of the polar region $R$ is
$$ A = \int_a^b \frac{1}{2}r^2 d\theta\text{.} $$

<div class="proof">  

Let $R$ be the region bounded by the polar curve $r = f(\theta)$ and by rays $\theta = a$ and $\theta = b$, 
where $f$ is a positive continuous function and where $0 < b - a \leq 2\pi$. We divide the interval $[a, b]$ into 
subintervals with endpoints $\inflate{\theta}{n}$ and equal width $\Delta{\theta}$. 

The rays $\theta = \theta_i$ then divide $R$ into $n$ smaller regions with central angle $\Delta{\theta} = \theta_i - \theta-{i-1}$.
If we choose $\theta_i^*$ in the $\spscript{i}{th}$ subinterval $[\theta_{i-1}, \theta_i]$, then the area $\Delta{A_i}$ of the 
$\spscript{i}{th}$ region is approximated by the area of a sector of a circle with central angle $\Delta{\theta}$ and radius
$f(\theta_i^*)$. Since an area of a sector of a circle is $A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$, we have 
$$ \Delta{A_i} \approx \frac{1}{2}[f(\theta_i^*)]^2\Delta{\theta}. $$
Thus the total area is 

$$ \xlimit{n}{\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{2}[f(\theta_i^*)]^2\Delta{\theta} = \int_a^b \frac{1}{2}[f(\theta)]^2 d\theta. $$
