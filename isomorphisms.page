![Fifth Roots of Unity](/img/diagrams/abstract/fifth-roots-of-unity.png)

Let $\lrangle{S,*}$ and $\lrangle{S',*'}$ be binary algebraic structures. An **isomorphism of $S$** with $S'$
is a one-to-one function $\phi$ mapping $S$ onto $S'$ such that $\phi$ satisfies the [homomorphism](homomorphisms) property.
This definition extends naturally to algebraic structures with more than one binary structure.

If such a map $\phi$ exists, then $S$ and $S'$ are **isomorphic binary structures**, which we denote by 
$S \simeq S'$, omitting the $*$ and $*'$ from the notation. By identifying isomorphic binary structures, we
can reason that any structural property shared by one structure must be shared by the other. These include,
but are not limited to, cardinality, commutativity, existence of an identity, etc.

Intuitively speaking, an isomorphism is merely a renaming of an element from one structure to that of another- the two
structures still represent the same data. For instance, the fifth roots of unity pictured to the right are isomorphic to
that of $\bbz_5$, so any properties found in one must be present in the other.

# Uniqueness of Identity

Let $\lrangle{S,*}$ be a binary structure. Then this binary structure has at most one identity element.

<div class="proof">

Suppose that both $e$ and $\bar{e}$ are elements of $S$ serving as identity elements. Regarding $e$ as an
identity element, we must have $e * \bar{e} = \bar{e}$. However, regarding $\bar{e}$ as an identity element,
we must have $e * \bar{e} = e$. Thus $e = \bar{e}$, showing the identity element is unique.

# Identity Under Isomorphism

Suppose $\lrangle{S,*}$ has an identity element $e$ for $*$. If $\phi: S \rightarrow S'$ is an
isomorphism of $\lrangle{S,*}$ with $\lrangle{S',*'}$, then $\phi(e)$ is an identity element for the binary
operation $*'$ on $S'$.

<div class="proof">
  
Let $s' \in S'$. We must show that $\phi(e) *' s' = s' *' \phi(e) = s'$. Because $\phi$ is an isomorphism,
it is a one-to-one map of $S$ onto $S'$. In particular, there exists $s \in S$ such that $\phi(s) = s'$.
Now $e$ is an identity element for $*$ so we know that $e * s = s * e = s$. Because $\phi$ is a function, then
$$ \phi(e * s) = \phi(s * e) = \phi(s). $$
By definition of an isomorphism,
$$ \phi(e) *' \phi(s) = \phi(s) *' \phi(e) = \phi(s). $$
Since $s \in S$ such that $\phi(s) = s'$, then $\phi(e) *' s' = s' *' \phi(e) = s'$.
