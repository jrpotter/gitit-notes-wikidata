# Banach Match Problem

At all times, a pipe-smoking mathematician carries 2 matchboxesâ€”1 in his left-hand pocket and 1 in his right-hand pocket. 
Each time he needs a match, he is equally likely to take it from either pocket. Consider the moment when the mathematician
first discovers that one of his matchboxes is empty. If it is assumed that both matchboxes initially contained $N$ matches,
the the probability there are exactly $k$ matches, $k = 0, 1, \ldots, N$,  in the other box is
$$ \binom{2N - k}{N}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2N-k}. $$

<div class="proof">

Let $E$ denote the event that the mathematician first discovers that the right-hand matchbox is empty and there
are $k$ matches in the left-hand box at the time. This event will occur if and only if the $\spscript{(N+1)}{th}$
choice of the right-hand matchbox is made at the $\spscript{(N + 1 + N - k)}{th}$ trial. Thus, by the negative
binomial distribution with $p = \frac{1}{2}, r = N + 1$, and $n = 2N - k + 1$, we see that
$$ \bbps{E} = \binom{2N - k}{N}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2N-k+1}. $$
Since there is an equal probability that it is the left-hand box that is first discovered to be empty and
there are $k$ matches in the right-hand box at that time, the desired result is 
$$ 2\bbps{E} = \binom{2N - k}{N}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2N-k}. $$
