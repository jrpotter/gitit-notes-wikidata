Probability and Statistics are two fields that go hand in hand; the former focuses on odds based off combinatoric arguments
while the latter focuses on determining probabilities given some data. That is, they work in opposite directions, providing a 
complete picture of the chances involved with a certain event. Nonetheless, statistics is often the word used to describe the
entire process. More interestingly, this field combines discrete and continuous mathematics in the form of different distributions 
and combinatoric arguments, providing a rich platform for application of other subjects.

Probability can be defined in several ways- the two leading interpretations are the classical interpretation and 
frequency interpretation. The classical interpretation states the probability of an event is proportional to the 
number of cases favorable for an outcome. The frequency interpretation defines an event's probability by the limit 
of its relative frequency given a large number of trials. In both cases, it can be difficult to work directly with 
these definitions. For example, by the frequency interpretation, a probability of an event E occurring is:
$$ \xlimit{n}{\infty} \frac{\sum_{i=i}^n \bbps{E_I}}{n}, $$
where $n$ is the number of trials of event $E$ and $E_I$ is an [indicator variable](expected_value#indicator-variables). 
In other words, it is the expected value of an infinite number of trials.
Generally speaking, instead of working with these limits we work with the [axioms of probability](axioms_of_probability).
