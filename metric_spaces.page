A **metric space** is a set $X$ with a metric $d: X \times X \rightarrow \bbr$, denoted $(X, d)$, satisfying for all $p, q \in X$:

1. $d(p, q) \geq 0$ with equality if and only if $p = q$.
2. $d(p, q) = d(q, p)$.
3. The [triangle inequality](triangle_inequality) holds; that is $d(p, q) \leq d(p, r) + d(r, q)$ for some $r \in X$.

Given a metric space $(X, d)$, we define the **diameter** of a set $A \subset X$ to be
$$ \text{diam}(A) = \text{sup}\{d(x, y): x, y \in A\}. $$

We can use the idea of metric spaces to generalize our theory of analysis further. In Advanced Calculus, we were limited to just
the real numbers, but most conclusions could be generalized to an arbitrary space that satisfies the above conditions.

# Completeness

A metric space $X$ in which every [Cauchy sequence](cauchy_sequences) converges to a point in $X$ is **complete**. It goes 
to show that any [compact](compact_sets) metric space is complete, and furthermore, that $\bbr$ is complete.
