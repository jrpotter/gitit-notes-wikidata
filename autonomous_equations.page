# Summary

First order equations in which the independent variable does not appear explicitly is called **autonomous** and have form
$$ \leibniz[y]{t} = f(y). $$
In particular, these equations are [separable](separable_equations) and can thus be solved for if necessary, though they
tend to be used more for modeling than anything else. These sets of equations can be classified according to what the
equation is trying to model. Demonstrated throughout this page are some of these models.

# Exponential Growth

Let $y = \phi(t)$ be the population of the given species at time $t$. Though a simple model, we can describe the variation
of the population as proportional to the current population:
$$ \leibniz[y]{t} = ry, $$
where $r$ is called the **rate of growth or decay** depending on whether it is positive or not. We note given initial condition
$$ y(0) = y_0, $$
then
$$ y = y_0 e^{rt}. $$

<div class="proof">

Note that
$$
  \leibniz[y]{t} = ry 
    \Rightarrow \leibniz{t}\left(\ln{y}\right) = r 
    \Rightarrow \ln{y} = rt + C 
    \Rightarrow y = e^{rt}e^{c} = Ce^{rt}
$$
Solving for $C$ yields $$ y = y_0 e^{rt}. $$

# Logistic Growth

Let $y = \phi(t)$ be the population of the given species at time $t$. We consider the equation
$$ \leibniz[y]{t} = r\left(1 - \frac{y}{K}\right)y $$
where $K = r/a$ and the constant $r$ is called the **intrinsic growth rate**. Note that when $y = 0$ or $y = K$ the
derivative is $0$ and thus the population is constant. These solutions are therefore called the **equilibrium solutions**.
Additionally, note that $K$ is the upper bound that is approached, but not exceeded, by growing populations starting below
this value. Thus $K$ is called the **saturation level**. Given initial condition
$$ y(0) = y_0, $$
we find that
$$ y = \dfrac{y_0K}{y_0 + (K - y_0)e^{rt}}. $$

<div class="proof">

Assuming $y \neq 0$ and $y \neq K$, we can write our autonomous equation as
$$ \frac{1}{(1-y/K)y}\leibniz[y]{t} = r. $$
Via [partial fraction](integration_techniques#partial-fractions) we find that
$$ \left(\frac{1}{y} + \frac{1/K}{1-y/K}\right)\leibniz[y]{t} = r. $$
Then integrating with respect to $t$, we have
$$ \ln{\big|y\big|} - \ln{\left|1-\frac{y}{K}\right|} = rt + c, $$
where $c$ is an arbitrary constant of integration to be determined from the initial condition $y(0) = y_0$. Since we are 
assuming $0 < y_0 < K$, then $y$ remains in this interval for all time, allowing removal of the absolute value bars. Therefore
$$ \frac{y}{1 - (y/K)} = Ce^{rt}, $$
where $C = e^c$. Solving for $C$ we obtain
$$ y = \dfrac{y_0K}{y_0 + (K - y_0)e^{rt}}. $$
