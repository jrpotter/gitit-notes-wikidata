The **universal Turing machine** is a Turing machine that interprets a description of other Turing machines. That is, we can convert
any Turing machine into an equivalent string representation- a universal Turing machine will then read in this string and perform
the computation of the given Turing machine being represented. Intuitively speaking, a universal Turing machine $U$ takes two
arguments, a description of a machine $M$, "$M$", and a description of an input string $w$, "$w$". Furthermore, $U$ halts on
input "$M$""$w$" if and only if $M$ halts on input $w$. Thus $$ U(\text{"}M\text{""}w\text{"}) = \text{"}M(w)\text{"}. $$

# Encoding

Let $M = (K, \Sigma, \delta, s, H)$ be a Turing machine, and let $i$ and $j$ be the smallest integers such that
$2^i \geq \abs{K}$, and $2^j \geq \abs{\Sigma} + 2$. Then each state in $K$ will be represented as a $q$ followed by
a binary string of length $i$; each symbol in $\Sigma$ will be represented as the letter $a$ followed by a string of $j$
bits (where the $+2$ term follows from the addition of $\leftarrow$ and $\rightarrow$ as symbols). Note this description
is necessary since the universal Turing machine needs to work over a finite alphabet, and any Turing machine can have
an arbitrary number of states and symbols.

Additionally, we fix the representations of the special symbols $\sqcup$, $\triangleright$, $\leftarrow$, and
$\rightarrow$ to be the lexicographically four smallest symbols respectively. That is, $\sqcup$ as $a0^j$,
$\triangleright$ as $a0^{j-1}1$, $\leftarrow$ as $a0^{j-2}10$, and $\rightarrow$ as $a0^{j-2}11$. Similarly the start
state will always be represented as the lexicographically first state, $q0^i$. The representation of this whole Turing
machine $M$ is then "$M$", which consists of the transition table $\delta$, with transitions separated by commas and
included in parentheses.
