# Summary

When considering solutions to a [second order linear homogeneous equation](homogeneous_equation), we are often given
initial values for $y$ and $y'$ so that we can solve for constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ in the equation
$y = c_1y_1(t) + c_2y_2(t)$ where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are two solutions of $L[y] = y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = 0$.
These initial conditions, which we'll denote $y_0$ and $y_0'$ respectively, enable the establishment of a system 
of equations as follows:
$$\begin{align*}
  c_1y_1(t_0) + c_2y_2(t_0) &= y_0     \\
  c_1y_1'(t_0) + c_2y_2'(t_0) &= y_0'.
\end{align*}$$
The [determinant](determinant) of coefficients of the system is called the **Wronskian** and is calculated as follows:
$$ 
  W = \left| \begin{array}{cc} y_1(t_0) & y_2(t_0) \\ y_1'(t_0) & y_2'(t_0) \end{array} \right|
    = y_1(t_0)y_2'(t_0) - y_1'(t_0)y_2(t_0).

# System of Homogeneous Equations

The idea of a Wronskian can be generalized to a [homogeneous linear system](homogeneous_linear_systems). Supposing we have
$n$ first order equations, we can consider the [superposition](homogeneous_linear_systems#principle-of-superposition) of
these $n$ solutions for another solution. These solutions $\pmb{x}^{(1)}, \ldots, \pmb{x}^{(n)}$ can be formed into a matrix
$$ 
  \pmb{X}(t) = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
    x_{11}(t) & \cdots & x_{1n}(t) \\
    \vdots    &        & \vdots    \\
    x_{n1}(t) & \cdots & x_{nn}(t)
  \end{array}\right).
$$
The determinant of this matrix is also called the Wronskian, denoted
$$ W\left[\pmb{x}^{(1)}, \ldots, \pmb{x}^{(n)}\right](t) = \text{det}\;\pmb{X}(t), $$
the columns of which are linearly independent for a given value of $t$ if and only if the determinant for
that value of $t$ is not $0$.

# Fundamental Set Construction

Consider the differential equation $L[y] = y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = 0$ whose coefficients $p$ and $q$ are continuous
on some open interval $I$. Choose some point $t_0$ in $I$. Let $y_1$ be the solution of $L[y]$ that also satisfies the
initial conditions $$ y(t_0) = 1 \;\text{ and }\; y'(t_0) = 0. $$ Additionally, let $y_2$ be the solution of $L[y]$ that 
satisfies the initial conditions $$ y(t_0) = 0 \;\text{ and }\; y'(t_0) = 1. $$ Then $y_1$ and $y_2$ form a fundamental set
of solutions of $L[y]$.

<div class="proof">

We note the existence of the functions $y_1$ and $y_2$ is ensured by [above](homogeneous_equations#existence-and-uniqueness).
We also note their Wronskian at $t_0$ is
$$ 
  W(y_1, y_2)(t_0) = \left| \begin{array}{cc} y_1(t_0) & y_2(t_0) \\ y_1'(t_0) & y_2'(t_0) \end{array} \right|
                   = \left| \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right| = 1.
$$
Since the Wronskian is not zero at the point $t_0$, the functions $y_1$ and $y_2$ for a fundamental set of solutions[^1].
