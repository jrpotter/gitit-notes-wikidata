# Summary

![Pierre-Simon Laplace](/img/portraits/laplace.jpg)

The study of Complex Variables revolves around the analysis of imaginary numbers, and the means of understanding how
to interpret them. To do so requires moving beyond the real numbers into the complex space, and considering numbers
consisting of two components (the real and imaginary parts). Furthermore, though these numbers can be interpreted
as a vector in $\bbr^2$, graphing these numbers requires graphing these components separately.

Despite the increased complexity inherent in adding another component to a number, many properties can be mapped into
the complex plane, especially when we realize the absolute value of a complex number is a real number (i.e. the length
of the vector representing the complex value). Because of the interpretation of the absolute value (which is also a
[homomorphism](homomorphism)), we can begin comparing numbers and regarding them in series like we would the reals.
Because of the vectorized interpretation of these numbers, we can apply general vector calculus (for the most part), 
with results that we also would expect.
