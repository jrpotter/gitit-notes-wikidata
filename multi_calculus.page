Multi-Variable Calculus refers to the subject focused on analyzing the change of a function of multiple variables with respect to 
some limiting factor. It is an abstraction that builds on [Single-Variable Calculus](single_calculus). In fact, problems
in multi-dimensional space are generally decomposed into their corresponding single dimensional components and processed in a manner
much like that in single-variable calculus, but repeatedly. For instance, to handle a double integral requires iterated integration,
a method employing the calculation of two single integrations of a function of just one variable. Differentiation of a two variable function involves partial differentiation in which only one variable is considered at a time. Both these, and most other concepts
explored in this subject, extend in a likewise manner to $n$-dimensional space.

One important distinction involves a higher emphasis on vector manipulation, which allows for an easier description of
parametric surfaces. This becomes especially prevalent in the subject of [Vector Calculus](#vector-calculus), which serves
as the basis of describing higher dimensions in a fairly intuitive manner. Incorporated in this emphasis is the shift away from
integration of Cartesian coordinates of a single function to line integration over a vector field, allowing a more generalized
notion of the summation of limiting differentials.
