# Summary

The Heine-Borel theorem relates compactness with closed and boundedness in a subset of $\bbr^k$. Note, in
the following three equivalences, only the first two are actually part of the theorem. The third is merely included for
convenience. Also note, that the equivalence of the first two statements are not true in every metric space, though the
second and third are. Now, let $E \subset \bbr^k$. Then all are equivalent:

1. $E$ is closed and bounded.
2. $E$ is compact.
3. Every infinite subset of $E$ has a limit point in $E$.

<div class="proof">

- Case $1 \Rightarrow 2$
:    Suppose $E$ is a bounded subset of $\bbr^k$. That is, $E$ is contained within some $k$-cell. But every 
     $k$-cell is compact[^1]. Since $E$ is a closed subset of a compact set, then $E$ must also be compact[^2].

- Case $2 \Rightarrow 3$
:    Suppose $E$ is compact. Then this follows exactly from the idea of [limit points](compact_sets#limit-points)
     in compact sets.

- Case $3 \Rightarrow 1$
:    We argue by contraposition. That is, suppose $E$ is not closed or not bounded. Then we need to product an infinite
     subset of $E$ without a limit point in $E$.<br />  
     Assume $E$ is not bounded. Then we can construct a sequence $K = \{x_n\} \subset E$ so that for all $M > 0$,
     there exists an $N \in \bbn$ such that for all $n \geq N$, $\abs{x_n} > M$ for all $M > 0$. We take this sequence
     to be our infinite subset. All that remains is showing this sequence does not have a limit point in $E$. To do
     this, fix $x \in \bbr^k$ and set $r = 1$. Then there exists an $M' > 0$ such that $N_1(x) \subset N_{M'}(0)$. Note
     that $N_{M'}(0)$ contains a finite number of elements of our sequence, and consequently so does $N_1(x)$. Denote
     these elements as $\inflate{x}{n}$. If we were to set
     $$ r' = \frac{1}{2}\mathop{\text{min}}_{j = 1, \ldots, N} d(x, x_j), $$
     we then see that $(N_{r'}(x) \cap E) \backslash \{x\} = \emptyset$ (remember the neighborhood refers only to elements
     within $K$). Since this holds for all $x \in \bbr^k$, we are finished.<br />  
     Next, suppose $E$ is not closed. Then there is some $x \in E' \cap E^C$, where $E'$ denotes the limit points of $E$.
     Now, for all $n > 0$, it follows that $$ N_{n^{-1}}(x) \cap E \neq \emptyset. $$
     Then choose $x_n \in N_{n^{-1}}(x) \cap E$ for all $n$ and establish a sequence of points $\{x_n\}$ with limit point $x$. 
     If we can show $x$ is the only limit point of $\{x_n\}$, an infinite sequence, then, since $x \not\in E$, we are finished.
     Therefore, suppose $p$ is a limit point of $\{x_n\}$ such that $p \neq x$. So $\abs{x - p} = \delta > 0$.
     Choose $N$ such that $\frac{1}{N} < \delta$. So for $n > N$,
     $$ \frac{1}{n} < \frac{1}{N} < \delta \Rightarrow \abs{x_n - x} < \delta. $$
     This implies only a finite number of points exist in $N_{n^{-1}}(p)$, further implying there exists some radius $r$
     such that $(N_r(p) \cap E) \backslash \{p\} = \emptyset$, a contradiction to the fact that $p$ is a limit point.
