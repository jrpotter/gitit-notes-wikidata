![Evaluation Homomorphism](/img/diagrams/abstract/evaluation-homomorphism.png)

We can extrapolate the idea of rings even further by introducing an **indeterminate** $x$. That is, for a ring $R$, there
exists a corresponding ring dubbed the polynomial ring with indeterminate $x$, denoted $R[x]$, under the operations of
polynomial addition and polynomial multiplication. Furthermore, if $R$ is commutative, then so is $R[x]$, and if
$R$ has unity $1 \neq 0$, then $1$ is also unity for $R[x]$.

Furthermore, we can introduce an arbitrary number of indeterminates if desired. Suppose $R$ is a ring and $x$ and $y$
are two indeterminaties. Then we can form the ring $(R[x])[y]$, which we note is equivalent to $(R[y])[x]$, and is
therefore denoted as $R[x, y]$. This can be generalized in a natural way.

This, combined with the evaluation homomorphism, allows us to phrase the problems of polynomials in the language
of mappings; as a result we can use all of our theory of homomorphisms to derive different solutions. That is, we
can establish notions of kernels and images, apply the [Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem](fundamental_homomorphism_theorem),
etc.

# Evaluation Homomorphism

Let $F$ be a subfield of a field $E$, $\alpha$ be any element of $E$, and $x$ be an indeterminate. Then the map
$\phi_\alpha: F[x] \rightarrow E$ defined by 
$$ \phi_\alpha\left(a_0 + a_1x + \cdots + a_nx^n\right) = a_0 + a_1\alpha + \cdots + a_n\alpha^n $$
for $(a_0 + a_1x + \cdots + a_nx^n) \in F[x]$ is a homomorphism of $F[x]$ into $E$. Also, $\phi_\alpha(x) = \alpha$,
and $\phi_\alpha$ maps $F$ isomorphically by the identity map; that is, $\phi_\alpha(a) = a$ for $a \in F$.

<div class="proof">

If $f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \cdots + a_nx^n$, $g(x) = b_0 + b_1x + \cdots + b_mx^m$, and 
$h(x) = f(x) + g(x) = c_0 + c_1x + \cdots + c_rx^r$, then 
$$ \phi_\alpha(f(x) + g(x)) = \phi_\alpha(h(x)) = c_0 + c_1\alpha + \cdots + c_r\alpha^r, $$
while 
$$ 
  \phi_\alpha(f(x)) + \phi_\alpha(g(x)) = 
  \left(a_0 + a_1\alpha + \cdots + a_n\alpha^n\right) + \left(b_0 + b_1\alpha + \cdots + b_m\alpha^m\right). 
$$
Thus, by polynomial addition we have $c_i = a_i + b_i$ and that
$$ \phi_\alpha(f(x) + g(x)) = \phi_\alpha(f(x)) + \phi_\alpha(g(x)). $$
Similarly, if $$ f(x)g(x) = d_0 + d_1x + \cdots + d_sx^s, $$ then
$$ \phi_\alpha(f(x)g(x)) = d_0 + d_1\alpha + \cdots + d_s\alpha^s, $$ while
$$ 
  [\phi_\alpha(f(x))][\phi_\alpha(g(x))] = 
  \left(a_0 + a_1\alpha + \cdots + a_n\alpha^n\right) + \left(b_0 + b_1\alpha + \cdots + b_m\alpha^m\right).
$$
Thus, by polynomial multiplication, we indeed have
$$ \phi_\alpha(f(x)g(x)) = [\phi_\alpha(f(x))][\phi_\alpha(g(x))]. $$
Therefore $\phi_\alpha$ is a homomorphism.

*****

We see that by definition of $\phi_\alpha$, we have
$$ \phi_\alpha(x) = \phi_\alpha(1x) = 1\alpha = \alpha. $$

*****

The very definition of $\phi_\alpha$ applied to a constant polynomial $a \in F[x]$, where $a \in F$, gives
$\phi_\alpha(a) = a$, so $\phi_\alpha$ maps $F$ isomorphically by the identity map (this is a mapping between
$F$ and $F[x]$).
