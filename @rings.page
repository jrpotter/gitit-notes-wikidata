# Freshman Exponentiation

Let $p$ be a prime. Then the ring $\bbz_p$ will have $$ (a + b)^p = a^p + b^p $$ for all $a, b \in \bbz_p$. That
is, we can view exponentiation distributively under a ring of prime order.

<div class="proof">

First, note that under commutative rings $R$, for all $a, b \in R$ we see that
$$ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + ab + ba + b^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. $$
Thus binomial expansion is valid. That is, $$ (a + b)^p = \sum_{k=0}^p \binom{p}{k} a^kb^{p-k}. $$
Now we note that for all $1 \leq k \leq p - 1$, $\binom{p}{k}$ is a multiple of $p$ since 
$$ \binom{p}{k} = \frac{p!}{k!(p-k)!}. $$
Now all multiples of $p$ evaluate to $0$ in $\bbz_p$, so the only nonzero terms are $a^p$ and $b^p$.
