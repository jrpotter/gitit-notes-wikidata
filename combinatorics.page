Combinatorics is the subject associated with counting a set of discrete objects, based on certain requirements or constraints.
Though the field derived from a more critical analysis of game theory and probability, it can be used to demonstrate a variety
of surprising results used in a variety of fields. Probably the most notable example of this is the binomial theorem (or the
more generalized multinomial theorem) used in calculus.

Furthermore, combinatorics is especially powerful as it formalizes many notions that we often take for granted, and perhaps
misapply. Because of its close ties to statistics, and the inherent disability of humans to seemingly grasp statistics accurately,
combinatorics becomes an incredibly valuable tool to set aside our misunderstandings. It is used to generalize concepts
that at first seem basic, such as the [pigeonhole principle](pigeonhole_principle), to stronger and stronger versions that can
be used on a wider variety of challenges, such as the [Theory of Ramsey](theory_of_ramsey).
