# Conservative Vector Fields

To reiterate, a differential equation $M(x, y) + N(x, y)y' = 0$ is exact if and only if $M_y(x, y) = N_x(x, y)$, under the
assumption that the partials are defined on a simply-connected region. Similarly, a vector field $\pmb{F} = P\pmb{i} + Q\pmb{j}$ 
on an open simply-connected region is conservative if and only if $$\pleibniz[P]{y} = \pleibniz[Q]{x}, $$
which brings to light the geometrical interpretation of exact equations. Namely, the solutions are the level curves
of the potential of the gradient vector field defined by
$$ \pmb{F} = M(x, y)\pmb{i} + N(x, y)\pmb{j}. $$

<div class="proof">

Consider the solution of $M(x, y) + N(x, y)y' = 0$. Suppose that we could identify a function $\psi$ such that
$$ \pleibniz[\psi]{x}(x, y) = M(x, y) \;\text{ and }\; \pleibniz[\psi]{y}(x, y) = N(x, y) $$
with the understanding that $\psi(x, y) = c$ defines $y = \phi(x)$ implicitly as a differentiable function of $x$.
Then by the [Chain Rule](chain_rule)
$$ M(x, y) + N(x, y)\leibniz[y]{x} = \pleibniz[\psi]{x} + \pleibniz[\psi]{y}\leibniz[y]{x} = \leibniz{x}\psi[x, \phi(x)] $$
and our differential equation becomes
$$ \leibniz{x}\psi[x, \phi(x)] = 0. $$
Therefore
$$ \psi(x, y) = C, $$
where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. Since $C$ can take on any value (meaning $\psi$ represents a family of solutions), we see
that the solutions to our differential equations are actually the level curves of $\psi$. As a reminder, we note that the 
[gradient](directional_derivatives) of a scalar function of two variables consists of vectors that are orthogonal to the 
level curves of the function (we can observe this by looking at the contour plot of a function of two variables). But also notice that $\psi$ is a scalar function of two variables meaning we can take the gradient:
$$ \nabla \psi(x, y) = M(x, y)\pmb{i} + N(x, y)\pmb{j}. $$
Thus we can further conclude that the functions $M$ and $N$ in our differential equation comprise the components of the
vectors orthogonal to the solution- namely the level curves of $\psi$.
