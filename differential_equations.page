Differential Equations is the subject dedicated to solving equations involving derivatives of some functions. In addition,
it is often associated with different modeling strategies, especially of biological or economical systems. In many cases,
"real-world" differential equations are difficult to solve, despite the numerous strategies that have cropped up, and, like
with integration, it is often best to approximate solutions as opposed to attempting to find any exact answers.

Equations can become arbitrarily complex in terms of "order," referring to the highest level of differentiation of some
function present in an equation or by nonlinearity, in which case many linear algebra techniques cannot be employed. That being
said, through different graphing and approximating techniques, one can solve most equations within some degree of accuracy.
