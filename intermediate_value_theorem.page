![Existence of Roots](/img/graphs/calculus/intermediate-value-theorem.png)

Suppose that $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and let $N$ be any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, where $f(a) \neq f(b)$. Then there exists a number $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f(c) = N$.

Note this is particularly useful for determining whether a function has roots. For example, a polynomial that passes
through the $x$-axis is guaranteed to have a root since all polynomials are continuous[^1].
