# Summary

Consider second order differential equation $$ L[y] = y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = g(t), $$ where $p$, $q$, and $g$ are given 
(continuous) functions on the open interval $I$. This equation is called **nonhomogeneous** if $g(t) \neq 0$. If $g(t) = 0$, 
we say the resulting equation is the corresponding [homogeneous equation](homogeneous_equations). If the corresponding
homogeneous equation can be solved, then all that is required is a slight generalization to solve the nonhomogeneous equation.
In fact, the general solution of the nonhomogeneous equation can be written in the form
$$ y = \phi(t) = c_1y_1(t) + c_2y_2(t) + Y(t), $$ where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are a fundamental set of solutions of the corresponding
homogeneous equation, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants, and $Y$ is some specific solution of the nonhomogeneous equation.

<div class="proof">

The proof follows quickly by first showing that if $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are two solutions of the nonhomogeneous equation $L[y]$, then
their difference $Y_1 - Y_2$ is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation. 
To show this result, we note that $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ satisfy the equations $$ L[Y_1](t) = g(t), \quad L[Y_2](t) = g(t). $$ 
Then, $$ L[Y_1](t) - L[Y_2](t) = L[Y_1 - Y_2] = g(t) - g(t) = 0. $$ Thus $Y_1 - Y_2$ is indeed a solution to the corresponding
homogeneous equation and, since all solutions of a homogeneous equation can be expressed as a linear combination of a [fundamental
set of solutions](homogeneous_equations#fundamental-set-of-solutions) (if a point exists in which the Wronskian is nonzero), it 
follows that the solution $Y_1 - Y_2$ can be written as $$ Y_1(t) - Y_2(t) = c_1y_1(t) + c_2y_2(t), $$ where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are 
certain constants and $y_1$ and $y_2$ form a fundamental set of solutions.
With this out of the way, identity $Y_1$ with an arbitrary solution $\phi$ of $L[y]$. Additionally, identify $Y_2$ with
the specific solution $Y$. Then by the previous result we get that $$ \phi(t) - Y(t) = c_1y_1(t) + c_2y_2(t). $$
Since $\phi$ is an arbitrary solution, all solutions are represented in this way.
