# Reduction Modulo (Addition)

Let $\gamma$ be the natural map of $\bbz$ into $\bbz_n$ given by $\gamma(m) = r$, where $r$ is the remainder given
by the division algorithm when $m$ is divided by $n$. Then $\gamma$ is a homomorphism under addition.

<div class="proof">

We need to show that $\gamma(s + t) = \gamma(s) + \gamma(t)$ for $s, t \in \bbz$. Using the division algorithm, we
let $s = q_1n + r_1$ and $t = q_2n + r_2$ where $0 \leq r_i < n$ for $i = 1, 2$. If $$ r_1 + r_2 = q_3n + r_3 $$
for $0 \leq r_3 < n$, then we see that $$ s + t = (q_1 + q_2 + q_3)n + r_3, $$ so $\gamma(s + t) = r_3$. Since
$\gamma(s) = r_1$ and $\gamma(t) = r_2$, then $\gamma(s) + \gamma(t) = r_3$ as well, proving this is a homomorphism.

# Reduction Modulo (Multiplication)

Let $\gamma$ be the natural map of $\bbz$ into $\bbz_n$ given by $\gamma(m) = r$, where $r$ is the remainder given
by the division algorithm when $m$ is divided by $n$. Then $\gamma$ is a homomorphism under multiplication.

<div class="proof">

Let $a = q_1n + r_1$ and $b = q_2n + r_2$. Then $$ \gamma(a)\gamma(b) = r_1r_2. $$ Yet we also see that
$$\begin{align*}
  \gamma(ab) &= \gamma(q_1q_2n^2 + q_2nr_1 + q_2nr_2 + r_1r_2) \\
             &= \gamma(n[q_1q_2n + q_2r_1 + q_1r_2] + r_1r_2)  \\
             &= r_1r_2.
\end{align*}$$

Thus $\gamma$ is an isomorphism.
