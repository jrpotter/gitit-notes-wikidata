![Cyclic Group $\bbz_6$](/img/diagrams/abstract/cyclic-group.png)

If $G$ is a group and $a \in G$, then $H = \{ a^n : n \in \bbz \}$ is a subgroup of $G$. This group 
is the **cyclic subgroup $\lrangle{a}$ of $G$ generated by $a$**. Note that all subgroups containing
$a$ must contain every element in $\lrangle{a}$: it is the smallest group containing $a$. 
Given a group $G$ and an element $a$ in $G$, if $G = \{ a^n : n \in \bbz \}$, then $a$ is a **generator of $G$** 
and the group $G = \lrangle{a}$ is **cyclic**. If the subgroup $\lrangle{a}$ is finite, then the **order of $a$**
is the order $\left|\lrangle{a}\right|$ of this cyclic subgroup. Otherwise $a$ is of **infinite order**.

As an aside, cyclic groups are especially important in that they serve as the building blocks of all sufficiently small
abelian groups (in particular, finite abelian groups). That is, we can completely describe all finite abelian groups,
up to isomorphism, through the use of cyclic groups.

</div>

<div class="proof">

We can show that for some group $G$ and element $a \in G$, $H = \{ a^n : n \in \bbz \}$ is both a group and the smallest 
subgroup of $G$ containing $a$ simultaneously. First off, we note that all groups must be closed, so any subgroup containing 
$a$ must contain $a^n$ for some positive integer $n$. Since for every $a^r, a^s \in H$ we have $a^ra^s = a^{r+s}$, $H$ must
be closed. 
Since inverses must exist, we must also have $a^{-m}$ for all $m \in \bbz^+$. Then we note $a^{-m}a^m = e$ as desired. 
Lastly, every group must contain the identity element which is conveniently represented as $a^0$. Therefore a subgroup of 
$G$ containing $a$ must contain all elements $a^n$ (or $na$ for additive groups) for all $n \in \bbz$.

# Abelian Property

As alluded to in the summary, cyclic groups are the "building blocks" of all finite abelian groups. Thus we would expect
a cyclic group itself to be abelian. That does in fact hold.

<div class="proof">

Let $G$ by a cyclic group and let $a$ be a generator of $G$ so that $G = \lrangle{a} = \{a^n : n \in \bbz\}$.
If $g_1$ and $g_2$ are any two elements of $G$, there exist integers $r$ and $s$ such that $g_1 = a^r$ and 
$g_2 = a^s$. Then
$$ g_1g_2 = a^ra^s = a^{r+s} = a^{s+r} = a^sa^r = g_2g_1, $$
so $G$ is abelian.

# Structure

<div class="block">

![Isomorphic Cyclic Groups](/img/diagrams/abstract/isomorphic-cyclic-groups.png)

Let $G$ be a cyclic group with generator $a$. If the order of $G$ is infinite, then $G$ is isomorphic to
$\lrangle{\bbz, +}$. If $G$ has finite order $n$, then $G$ is isomorphic to $\lrangle{\bbz_n, +_n}$. Note
that we are claiming to be able to describe the structure of all cyclic groups in one fell swoop.

We also note the above is saying that there is only one infinite cyclic group up to isomorphism. Therefore
any group of infinite order that claims to be cyclic must have exactly two generators corresponding to
$1$ and $-1$.

</div>

<div class="proof">

Case I
:    Suppose the order of $G$ is infinite. Then for all positive integers $m$, $a^m \neq e$. In this case
     we claim that no two distinct exponents $h$ and $k$ can give equal elements $a^h$ and $a^k$ of $G$.
     Suppose that $a^h = a^k$ and say $h > k$. Then
     $$ a^ha^{-k} = a^{h-k} = e, $$
     contrary to the assumption that no $a^m = e$ for all $m \in \bbz^+$. Hence very element of $G$ can
     be expressed as $a^m$ for a unique $m \in \bbz$. The map $\phi: G \rightarrow \bbz$ given by
     $\phi(a^i) = i$ is thus well defined, one to one, and onto $\bbz$. Also,
     $$ \phi(a^ia^j) = \phi(a^{i+j}) = i + j = \phi(a^i) + \phi(a^j) $$
     so the homomorphism property is satisfied and $\phi$ is indeed an isomorphism.

<br />

Case II
:    Suppose $G$ has finite order. Then $a^m = e$ for some positive integer $m$. Let $n$ be the smallest
     positive integer such that $a^n = e$. If $s \in \bbz$ and $s = nq + r$ for $0 \leq r < n$, then
     $a^s = a^{nq + r} = \left(a^n\right)^qa^r = e^qa^r = a^r$. As in Case 1, if $0 < k < h < n$ and
     $a^h = a^k$, then $a^{h-k} = e$ and $0 < h - k < n$, contradicting our choice of $n$. Thus the elements
     $$ a^0 = e, a, a^2, a^3, \ldots, a^{n-1} $$
     are all distinct and comprise all elements of $G$. The map $\psi: G \rightarrow \bbz_n$ given by
     $\psi(a^i) = i$ for $i = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n - 1$ is thus well defined, one to one, and onto $\bbz_n$.
     Because $a^n = e$, we see that $a^ia^j = a^k$ where $k = i +_n j$. Thus
     $$ \psi(a^ia^j) = i +_n j = \psi(a^i) +_n \psi(a^j), $$
     so the homomorphism property is satisfied and $\psi$ is an isomorphism.

# Subgroups

<section class="secondary">

## Cyclicality

We note that the subgroup of every cyclic group must be cyclic. Note this is especially useful in classifying
infinite cyclic groups since an immediate consequence is the subgroups of $\bbz$ under addition must be precisely the
groups $n\bbz$ under addition for $n \in \bbz$.

<div class="proof">

Let $G$ be a cyclic group generated by $a$ and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. If $H = \{e\}$, then
$H = \lrangle{e}$ is cyclic. If $H \neq \{e\}$, then $a^n \in H$ for some $n \in \bbz^+$. Let $m$ be
the smallest integer in $\bbz^+$ such that $a^m \in H$ (it is the "smallest" element besides $e$ in $H$).
We claim that $c = a^m$ generates $H$; that is,
$$ H = \lrangle{a^m} = \lrangle{c}. $$
In order to prove this claim, we must show that every $b \in H$ is a power of $c$. Since $b \in H$ and
$H \leq G$, we have $b = a^n$ for some $n$. Then by the [division algorithm](division_algorithm) we can
find a $q$ and $r$ such that
$$ n = mq + r \quad\text{ for }\quad 0 \leq r < m. $$
Therefore $$ a^n = a^{mq + r} = \left(a^m\right)^q a^r, $$
so $$ a^r = \left( a^m \right)^{-q} a^n. $$
Since $H$ is a group and $a^n, a^m \in H$, then $a^r \in H$. Furthermore, since $m$ was the smallest positive
integer such that $a^m \in H$ and $0 \leq r < m$, we must have $r = 0$. Thus $n = qm$ and
$$ b = a^n = (a^m)^q = c^q, $$
so $b$ is a power of $c$.

## Cardinality

Let $G$ be a cyclic group with $n$ elements and generated by $a$. Let $b \in G$ and let $b = a^s$. Then
$b$ generates a cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$ containing $n/d$ elements, where $d$ is the greatest common
divisor of $n$ and $s$. Also, $\lrangle{a^s} = \lrangle{a^t}$ if and only if 
$\text{gcd}(s, n) = \text{gcd}(t, n)$. This immediately tells us the generators of a cyclic
group are those of form $a^r$ where $r$ is relatively prime to $n$.

<div class="proof">

That $b$ generates a cyclic subgroup is proven in the section labeled [cyclicality](#cyclicality). We need
show only that $H$ has $n/d$ elements. Noting that $H$ has as many elements as the smallest positive power
$m$ of $b$ that gives the identity, $b = a^s$ and $b^m = e$ if and only if $(a^s)^m = e$, or if and only
if $n$ divides $ms$. Since we want to find the smallest positive integer of $m$ such that $n$ divides $ms$, we
let $d$ be the gcd of $n$ and $s$. Then there exists integers $u$ and $v$ such that
$$ d = un + vs. $$
Since $d$ divides both $n$ and $s$, we may write
$$ 1 = u(n/d) + v(s/d) $$
where both $n/d$ and $s/d$ are integers. This last equation shows that $n/d$ and $s/d$ are relatively
prime, for any integer dividing both of them must also divide $1$. We wish to find the smallest positive
$m$ such that
$$ \frac{ms}{n} = \frac{m(s/d)}{(n/d)} \text{ is an integer}. $$
But by [prime relativity](greatest_common_divisor#prime-relativity), we conclude that $n/d$ must divide $m$,
so the smallest such $m$ is $n/d$. Thus the order of $H$ is $n/d$.

Now, taking $\bbz_n$ as a model for a cyclic group of order $n$, we see that if $d$ is a divisor of $n$,
then the cyclic subgroup $\lrangle{d}$ of $\bbz^n$ has $n/d$ elements, and contains all the positive integers
$m$ less than $n$ such that $\text{gcd}(m, n) = d$ (note this does not mean that every element in the group
has this gcd; rather, this states that those who share this gcd must also be in the group). Thus there is only one 
subgroup of $\bbz^n$ of order $n/d$, since all elements which have order $n/d$ are in all the other groups generated
by an element with order $n/d$. Taken with the preceding paragraph, this shows at once that if $a$ is a generator of 
the cyclic group $G$, then $\lrangle{a^s} = \lrangle{a^t}$ if and only if $\text{gcd}(s, n) = \text{gcd}(t, n)$.
