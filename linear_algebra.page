Linear Algebra is a subset of algebra focused on the transformations described by a system of linear equations, that is,
a system of equations involving only scalar multiplication and addition of components. This field is especially important
as it provides relatively efficient means of manipulating large amounts of data in a compounded way via matrices and vectors,
as well as provides a rich system of transformations that are applied to data. In fact, I'd go as far as to state that
linear algebra is the basis of applied mathematics in general.

By generalizing the notion of spaces, we can apply linear algebra in a variety of different settings. For example, 
in [Abstract Algebra](abstract_algebra), the set of invertible $2 \times 2$ matrices, denoted $GL_2(\bbr)$, is a group
of transformations, and in [Calculus](single_variable_calculus), differentiation and integration are linear operations.
In addition, the use of [eigenvalues and eigenvectors](#subspaces) prove incredibly useful in differential equations.
As such, most theory that apply to subspaces of vector spaces also apply to linear spaces, since the coordinate 
transformation guarantees an isomorphism between said linear space and some subspace of $\bbr^n$ for some $n \in \bbz^+$.
