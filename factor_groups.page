![Cosets of $\bbz/8\bbz$](/img/diagrams/abstract/cosets-z8z.png)

Let $\phi: G \rightarrow G'$ be a group homomorphism with kernel $H$. Then the cosets of $H$ form a **factor group**, 
$G/H$, where $(aH)(bH) = (ab)H$. Also, the map $\mu : G/H \rightarrow \phi[G]$ defined by $\mu(aH) = \phi(a)$ is
an isomorphism. Both coset multiplication and $\mu$ are well defined, independent of the choices $a$ and $b$ from 
the cosets. 

To clarify, we can perform the computations of a factor group by taking any two elements of a given coset,
and considering the resulting coset obtained by performing the group operation between those two elements.
Though the above is used to show that all homomorphisms $\phi: G \rightarrow G'$ yield a natural factor group (namely
$G/\text{Ker}(\phi)$), the notion of factor groups is not restricted to just cosets of the kernel. Instead, we find
that all subgroups that are [normal](normal_subgroups) will likewise yield a factor group.

<div class="proof">

Let $G$ be a group and $S$ be a set with the same cardinality. Then we can define a one-to-one correspondence
$\leftrightarrow$ between $S$ and $G$. We then define $\mu: S \rightarrow G$ to be the forward direction of the
previous operation. That is, for $x, y \in S$, we have
$$ \text{if } \mu(x) = g_1 \text{ and } \mu(y) = g_2 \text{ and } \mu(z) = g_1g_2 \text{ then } xy = z. $$

This mapping is an isomorphism, with the homomorphism property deriving from the fact that 
$$ \mu(xy) = \mu(z) = g_1g_2 = \mu(x)\mu(y). $$

Let $G$ and $G'$ be groups, let $\phi: G \rightarrow G'$ be a homomorphism, and let $H = \text{Ker}(\phi)$.
By the [properties of the kernel of homomorphisms](homomorphisms#kernel), we have 
$$ \phi^{-1}[\{\phi(a)\}] = aH = Ha. $$

Thus there exists a map $\phi^{-1}$ that corresponds $\phi(a)$ to $aH$; that is, we have a one-to-one correspondence
$aH \leftrightarrow \phi(a)$ between cosets of $H$ in $G$ and elements of the subgroup $\phi[G]$ of $G'$. Furthermore,
since if $x \in aH$ we have $\phi(x) = \phi(a)$, and because $aH \leftrightarrow \phi(a)$, we see that the
computation of an element of $\phi[G]$ corresponding to the coset $aH = xH$ is the same whether we compute it as
$\phi(a)$ or as $\phi(x)$. These set of cosets of $H$ is denoted by $G/H$.

Because we have a one-to-one correspondence, we can utilize the isomorphism $\mu$ (the correspondence in
one direction) as defined above. Considering set $G/H$ and noting it has the same cardinality as group $\phi[G]$,
we see that $G/H$ is a group isomorphic to $\phi[G]$ via isomorphism $\mu$. Thus we see for $xH, yH \in G/H$ that
$$ 
  \text{if } \mu(xH) = \phi(x) \text{ and } \mu(yH) = \phi(y) 
  \text{ and } \mu(zH) = \phi(x)\phi(y) \text{ then } (xH)(yH) = zH.
$$
And, taking $z = xy$ in $G$, we find that $$ \mu(zH) = \mu(xyH) = \phi(xy) = \phi(x)\phi(y). $$
Therefore the product $(xH)(yH)$ of two cosets is the coset $(xy)H$ that contains the product $xy$ of $x$ and $y$
in $G$.

# Cyclicality

Factor groups prove especially easy to compute in if we know how the original group behaves. In particular, a factor group of a cyclic group is cyclic.

<div class="proof">

Let $G$ be a cyclic group with generator $A$ and $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. Then the coset $aN$
generates $G/N$, which can be proven by computing the powers of $aN$. Via representatives, this amounts
to computing the powers of $a$, which give all the elements in $G$. Consequently, the powers of $aN$
certainly give all cosets of $N$ and $G/N$ is cyclic.
