It is very simple to find the length of a straight line simply via the [Pythagorean Theorem](/LA/pythagorean_theorem),
but it is less obvious how to find the length of a curve. Using limits, we can approximate the value arbitrarily by
creating a series of straight lines along the given curve, and increasing the number of these lines to infinity.
    
We define the **length** $L$ of the curve $C$ with equation $y=f(x)$, $a\leq x\leq b$, as the limit of
the lengths of inscribed polygons (if the limit exists): 
$$ L = \xlimit{n}{\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n\left|P_{i-1}P_i\right|\text{.} $$

# Arc Length Formula

The arc length formula can be generalized for any curve. 

<section class="secondary">

## Cartesian Curves

If $f'$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then the length of the curve $y=f(x), a\leq x \leq b$, is
$$ L = \int_a^b\sqrt{1 + [f'(x)]^2}dx\text{.} $$

<div class="proof">

Letting $\Delta{y_i} = y_i - y_{i-1}$, then
$$ \left|P_{i-1}P_i\right| = \sqrt{(x_i-x_{i-1}^2 + (y_i-y_{i-1})^2} = \sqrt{(\Delta{x})^2+(\Delta{y_i})^2}\text{.} $$
By applying the [Mean Value Theorem](mean_value_theorem) to $f$ on the interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$, we find that there exists
a number $x_i^*$ between $x_{i-1}$ and $x_i$ such that
$$\begin{align*}
  f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1}) &= f'(x_i^*)(x_i - x_{i-1}) \\
  \Delta{y_i} &= f'(x_i^*)\Delta{x}\text{.}
\end{align*}$$
Thus
$$\begin{align*}
  \left|P_{i-1}P_i\right| &= \sqrt{(\Delta{x})^2+(\Delta{y_i})^2} = \sqrt{(\Delta{x})^2+[f'(x_i^*)\Delta{x}])^2}    \\
                          &= \sqrt{1 + [f'(x_i^*)]^2}\sqrt{(\Delta{x})^2} = \sqrt{1+[f'(x_i^*)]^2}\Delta{x}\text{.}
\end{align*}$$
Thus, by definition of length,
$$
  L = \xlimit{x}{\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n\left|P_{i-1}P_i\right|
    = \xlimit{n}{\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n\sqrt{1+[f'(x_i^*)]^2}\Delta{x}\text{.}
$$
By the definition of a definite integral, and because $g(x) = \sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2}$ is continuous,
$$ \int_a^b\sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2}dx\text{.} $$

## Parametric Curves

If a curve $C$ is described by the parametric equations $x = f(t), y = g(t), \alpha \leq t \leq \beta$, where
$f'$ and $g'$ are continuous on $[\alpha, \beta]$ and $C$ is traversed exactly once as $t$ increases
from $\alpha$ to $\beta$, then the length of $C$ is 
$$ L = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sqrt{[f'(t)]^2 + [g'(t)]^2}dt\text{.} $$

<div class="proof"> 
Divide the parameter interval $[\alpha, \beta]$ into $n$ subintervals of equal width $\Delta{t}$. If $t_0, t_1, t_2, \ldots$
are endpoints of these subintervals, then $P_i(x_i, y_i)$ is a point on $C$ where $x_i = f(t_i)$ and $y_i = g(t_i)$. Then
the polyline with vertices $\inflate{P}{n}$ approximates $C$. We define the length $L$ to be the limit of the lengths
of these approximating lines as $n \rightarrow \infty$: 
$$ L = \xlimit{n}{\infty} \sum_{i=1}^n \left|P_{i-1}P_i\right|\text{.} $$
The [Mean Value Theorem](mean_value_theorem) when applied to $f$ and $g$ on the interval $[t_{i-1}, t_i]$ 
gives a number $t_i^*$ and $t_i^{**}$ in $(t_{i-1}, t_i)$ such that
$$\begin{align*}
  f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1}) &= f'(t_i^*)(t_i - t_{i-1}) \text{, and } \\
  g(t_i) - g(t_{i-1}) &= g'(t_i^{**})(t_i - t_{i-1})\text{ respectively.}
\end{align*}$$
Letting $\Delta{x_i} = x_i - x_{i-1}, \Delta{y_i} = y_i - y_{i-1}$, these equation becomes
$$ \Delta{x_i} = f'(t_i^*)\Delta{t}\text{ and } \Delta{y_i} = g'(t_i^{**})\Delta{t}\text{.} $$
Therefore
$$\begin{align*}
  \left|P_{i-1}P_i\right| &= \sqrt{(\Delta{x_i})^2 + (\Delta{y_i})^2} 
                           = \sqrt{[f'(t_i^*)\Delta{t}]^2 + [g'(t_i^{**})\Delta{t}]^2} \\
                          &= \sqrt{[f'(t_i^*)]^2 + [g'(t_i^{**})]^2}\Delta{t}
\end{align*}$$
Despite $t_i^* \neq t_i^{**}$ in general, if $f'$ and $g'$ are continuous, then
$$ 
  L = \xlimit{n}{\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{[f'(t_i^*)]^2 + [g'(t_i^{**})]^2}\Delta{t} 
     = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sqrt{[f'(t)]^2 + [g'(t)]^2}dt\text{.}
$$

## Polar Curves

Given curve $r = f(\theta), a \leq \theta \leq b$, the length of this curve is 
$$ L = \int_a^b \sqrt{r^2 + [f'(\theta)]^2}d\theta\text{.} $$

<div class="proof">
Regard $\theta$ as a parameter and write parametric equations of the curve as
$$ x = r\cos{\theta} = f(\theta)\cos{\theta},\quad y = r\sin{\theta} = f(\theta)\sin{\theta}\text{.} $$
Using the [Product Rule](rules_of_differentiation#product-rule) and differentiating with respect to $\theta$, we obtain
$$ 
  \leibniz[x]{\theta} = \leibniz[r]{\theta}\cos{\theta} - r\sin{\theta},\quad \leibniz[y]{\theta} 
                      = \leibniz[r]{\theta}\sin{\theta} + r\cos{\theta}
$$
so, using $\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1$, we have
$$ \left(\leibniz[x]{\theta}\right)^2 + \left(\leibniz[y]{\theta}\right)^2 = \left(\leibniz[r]{\theta}\right)^2 + r^2\text{.} $$
Assuming that $f'$ is continuous, we then use the arc length of a parametric curve
$$ L = \int_a^b \sqrt{\left(\leibniz[x]{\theta}\right)^2 + \left(\leibniz[y]{\theta}\right)^2}d\theta $$
and, substituting, find that the length of a curve with polar equation $r = f(\theta), a \leq \theta \leq b$, is
$$ L = \int_a^b \sqrt{r^2 + [f'(\theta)]^2}d\theta\text{.} $$
</div>

## Space Curves

Suppose a curve has vector equation $\vec{r}(t) = \langle \;f(t), g(t), h(t) \rangle$, $a \leq t \leq b$, or equivalently,
the parametric equations $x = f(t), y = g(t), z = h(t)$, where $f', g'$, and $h'$ are continuous. If the curve is traversed
exactly once as $t$ increases from $a$ to $b$, then its length is

$$ L = \int_a^b \sqrt{[f'(t)]^2 + [g'(t)]^2 + [h'(t)]^2}\;dt. $$

Note this formula is a generalization of the [parametric arc length](#parametric-curves) 
(which consists of a vector of two components). Because arc length arises naturally from the shape of the curve, curves
are often reparameterized in terms of the arc length $s$ where 

$$ s(t) = \int_a^t\left|\vec{r}\;'(u)\right|du = \int_a^t \sqrt{[f'(t)]^2 + [g'(t)]^2 + [h'(t)]^2}\;dt. $$
