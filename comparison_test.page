# Summary

Suppose that $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ are series with positive terms. Then

1. If $\sum b_n$ is convergent and $a_n \leq b_n$ for all $n$. then $\sum a_n$ is also convergent.<br />  
2. If $\sum b_n$ is divergent and $a_n \geq b_n$ for all $n$, then $\sum a_n$ is also divergent.<br />  

<div class="proof">

- Case 1
:    Let $$ s_n = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i, t_n = \sum_{i=1}^n b_i, \text{ and } t = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_n. $$
     Since both series have positive terms, the sequences $\{s_n\}$ and $\{t_n\}$ are increasing. Also 
     $t_n \rightarrow t$, so $t_n \leq t$ for all $n$. Since $a_i \leq b_i$, we have $s_n \leq t_n$. Thus $s_n \leq t$ for 
     all $n$. This means that $\{s_n\}$ is increasing and bounded above and therefore converges by the 
     [Monotonic Sequence Theorem](monotonic_sequence_theorem). Thus $\sum a_n$ converges.

- Case 2
:    If $\sum b_n$ is divergent, then $t_n \rightarrow \infty$. But $a_i \geq b_i$ so $s_n \geq t_n$. Thus
     $s_n \rightarrow \infty$. Therefore $\sum a_n$ diverges.

# Limit Comparison Test

Suppose that $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ are series with positive terms. If
$$ \xlimit{n}{\infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = c $$ where $c$ is a finite number and $c > 0$, then either both
series converge or both diverge.

<div class="proof">

Let $m$ and $M$ be positive numbers such that $m < c < M$. Because $a_n/b_n$ is close to $c$ for large $n$,
there is an integer $N$ such that $$ m < \frac{a_n}{b_n} < M,\quad \text{when }n > N $$ and so
$$ mb_n < a_n < Mb_n,\quad \text{when }n > N\text{.} $$ 
If $\sum b_n$ converges, so does $\sum Mb_n$. Thus $\sum a_n$ converges by part (1) of the Comparison Test.
If $\sum b_n$ diverges, so does $\sum mb_n$ and part (2) of the Comparison Test shows that $\sum a_n$ diverges.
