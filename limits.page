![Multiple Limit Types](/img/graphs/calculus/infinite-limits.png)

The limit, in an intuitive sense, is the value a mathematical object (such as a function, integral, sequence, etc.)
seemingly takes the closer it gets to a point. Note this may be independent of the actual value at the point; for
example given some function $f$ defined on an open interval around a point $a$, it is not necessary for the point $a$ to exist.

The notion of a limit serves as the foundation upon which differential and integral calculus is built on. It enables 
one to differentiate and integrate a variety of different curves through the employment of [tangent lines](tangent_lines) 
and Riemann sums respectively. Under this context of functions, if the point at a certain limit does exist 
and equals the limit, then the function is said to be [continuous](Continuity), implying additional properties for
manipulation.

Under the context of sequences and series it allows reasoning about infinite sums, which initially seems impossible
to calculate, and construction of equivalent [power series](power_series) expansions of familiar functions equivalent in value.

![One-Sided Limits](/img/graphs/calculus/one-sided-limits.png)

Because of the generalized notion of a limit, a variety of possible definitions exist. These exist in forms such as 
purely algebraic, purely topological, etc. What follows it the $\epsilon-\delta$ form of the definition. We write 
$$\xlimit{x}{a}\;f(x)=L$$ and say, **the limit of $f(x)$, as $x$ 
approaches $a$, equals $L$** if we can make the values of $f(x)$ arbitrarily close to $L$ by taking $x$ to be sufficiently 
close to, but not equal to, $a$. 
More precisely, let $\;f$ be a function defined on some open interval that contains the number $a$, except possibly $a$ itself. 
Then we say that the **limit of $\;f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is $L$** and we write $\xlimit{x}{a}\;f(x) = L$ if for 
every number $\epsilon > 0$ there is a number $\delta > 0$ such that if 
$$ 0 < \left|x - a\right| < \delta \text{ then } \left|\;f(x)-L\right| < \epsilon. $$

## Complex Functions

Suppose $\;f$ is a function defined on a subset $S$ of the complex plane. Let $z_0$ be a point either in $S$ or in the boundary
of $S$. We say that $\;f$ has **limit** $L$ at the point $z_0$, and we write
$$ \xlimit{z}{z_0} \;f(z) = L $$
if, given $\epsilon > 0$, there is a $\delta > 0$ such that
$$ \norm{\;f(z) - L} < \epsilon \text{ whenever } z \in S \text{ and } \norm{z - z_0} < \delta. $$
Note the similarity with [Multi-variable limits](#multi-variable-functions).

# Multi-variable Functions

<div class="block">

![Multi-Variable Limit](/img/graphs/calculus/multi-variable-limit.png)

Let $f$ be a function of two variables whose domain $D$ includes points arbitrarily close to $(a, b)$. 
Then we say that the **limit of $f(x, y)$ as $(x, y)$ approaches $(a, b)$** is $L$ and we write
$$ \xlimit{(x, y)}{(a, b)}\; f(x, y) = L $$
if for every number $\epsilon > 0$ there is a corresponding number $\delta > 0$ such that if $(x, y) \in D$ and
$0 < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2} < \delta$ then $\left|\;f(x, y) - L\right| < \epsilon$. Generalizing further, 
if $f$ is defined on a subset $D$ of $\bbr^n$, then 
$$ \xlimit{\pmb{x}}{\pmb{a}}\;f(\pmb{x}) = L $$ 
means that for every number $\epsilon > 0$, there is a corresponding number $\delta > 0$ such that if $\pmb{x} \in D$ and
$0 < \left|\pmb{x} - \pmb{a}\right| < \delta$, then $\left|\;f(\pmb{x})-L\right| < \epsilon$.

# Sequences

<div class="block">

![Monotonic Sequence Theorem](/img/graphs/calculus/monotonic-sequence-theorem.png)

Let $\{a_n\}$ be a sequence of real numbers. We write that $\{a_n\}$ has the **limit** L
$$ \xlimit{n}{\infty}a_n = L \text{ or } a_n \rightarrow L\text{ as } n \rightarrow \infty $$
if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there is a corresponding integer $N$ such that if $n > N$  then $\left|a_n - L\right| < \epsilon$.

<section class="secondary">

## Complex Sequences

Similarly, let $\{z_n\} = \{x_n + iy_n\}$ be a sequence of complex numbers. Then we say $\{z_n\}$ approaches the limit 
$L = s + it$ if for every positive number $\epsilon$, there is an integer $N$ such that
$$ \norm{z_n - A} < \epsilon \quad \text{ for all } n \geq N. $$
Alternatively, we say $\{z_n\}$ approaches $L$ if and only if $x_n \rightarrow s$ and $y_n \rightarrow t$. 
This is a direct consequence of the fact that
$$ 
  \abs{x_n - s} \leq \abs{z_n - A}, \quad 
  \abs{y_n - t} \leq \abs{z_n - A}, \; \text{ and } \;
  \abs{z_n - A} \leq \abs{x_n - s} + \abs{y_n - t}. 
$$
