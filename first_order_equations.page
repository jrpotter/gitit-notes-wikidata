![Sample First Order Equation](/img/graphs/diffeq/integral-curves-separable-2.png)

First off, we note that differential equations have an order associated with them, as well as a classification of
**ordinary** or **partial** depending on whether the derivatives in the given equation are ordinary derivatives
or partial derivatives respectively. Furthermore, an equation may be linear or nonlinear. A first order equation is 
one in which the order of the highest derivative is one; that is, no derivatives of derivatives are present in the equation.

In general, a **first order linear equation** in standard form is
$$ \leibniz[y]{t} + p(t)y = g(t), $$
where $p$ and $g$ are given functions of the independent variable $t$.
Straightforward integration can be achieved in some cases, though this does not always hold. Certain strategies are
presented in the [additional notes](#see-also). An even more general model, one that encompasses nonlinear equations
as well, is
$$ \leibniz[y]{x} = f(x, y) $$
where $y$ is a function of $x$.

# Interval of Validity

The **interval of validity** of an initial value problem with conditions
$$ y(t_0) = y_0 \;\text{ and/or }\; y^{k}(t_0) = y_k $$
is the largest possible interval on which the solution is valid and contains $t_0$.

# Existence and Uniqueness

Let the functions $f$ and $\partial f / \partial y$ be continuous in some rectangle $\alpha < t < \beta$, 
$\gamma < y < \delta$ containing the point $(t_0, y_0)$. Then, in some interval $t_0 - h < t < t_0 + h$ contained
in $\alpha < t < \beta$, there is a unique solution $y = \phi(t)$ of the initial value problem
$$ y' = f(t, y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0. $$
