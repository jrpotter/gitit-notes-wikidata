![Monotonic Sequence Theorem](/img/graphs/calculus/monotonic-sequence-theorem.png)

A **sequence** is a list of numbers written in a definite order: $$ \inflate{a}{n}, \ldots $$ Sequences are also denoted 
$\{a_n\}$ and $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$. A **series** is the sequence generated by the partial sums of a sequence. That is, 
if we try to add the terms of an infinite sequence $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ we get an expression of the form 
$$ \inflate[+]{a}{n} + \cdots $$ and is denoted by the symbols $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \text{ or } \sum a_n. $$

# Convergence

Given a series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots$, let $s_n$ denote its $\spscript{n}{th}$ partial sum:
$$ s_n = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i = \inflate[+]{a}{n}\text{.} $$ 
If the sequence $\{s_n\}$ is convergent and $\xlimit{n}{\infty} s_n = s$ exists as a real number, then the series 
$\sum a_n$ is called **convergent** and we write
$$ \inflate[+]{a}{n} + \cdots = s\text{ or } \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = s\text{.} $$
The number $s$ is called the **sum** of the series. Otherwise, the series is **divergent**.
Furthermore, we state a series $\sum a_n$ is **absolutely convergent** if the series of absolute values 
$\sum \left|a_n\right|$ is convergent, and **conditionally convergent** if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent.

## Limits to Infinity

If the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ is convergent, then $\xlimit{n}{\infty} a_n = 0$.

<div class="proof"> 

Let $s_n = \inflate[+]{a}{n}$. Then $a_n = s_n - s_{n-1}$. Since $\sum a_n$ is convergent, the sequence $\{s_n\}$ is convergent.
Let $\xlimit{n}{\infty} s_n = s$. Since $$ n - 1 \rightarrow \infty \text{ as } n \rightarrow \infty, $$ we also have 
$\xlimit{n}{\infty} s_{n-1} = s$. Therefore

$$\begin{align*}
  \xlimit{n}{\infty} a_n &= \xlimit{n}{\infty}(s_n - s_{n-1})                   \\
                         &= \xlimit{n}{\infty} s_n - \xlimit{n}{\infty} s_{n-1} \\
                         &= s - s = 0.
\end{align*}$$

# Complex Series

The notion of a series is almost identically to that of real series, so only the differences are highlighted here.
Namely, the convergence or divergence of the infinite series $\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} z_j$ of complex numbers can
be formulated in terms of the convergence or divergence of two infinite series of real numbers. That is,
$$ s_n = \sum_{j=1}^n z_j = \sum_{j=1}^n x_j + i\sum_{j=1}^n y_j = \sigma_n + i\tau_n, $$
which implies that the infinite series $\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} z_j$ converges or diverges if and only if both
$$ \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} x_j \text{ and } \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} y_j $$ converge. Therefore, if $\sum z_j$ converges,
then $$ \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} z_j = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} x_j + i \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} y_j. $$
