# Summary

The inner product serves as a generalization of the [dot product](dot_product), allowing one to consider
orthogonality of linear spaces in the same way one might with vector spaces. By applying an inner product
in place of the dot product and a linear space in place of a vector space, one can decompose functions into
[orthogonal projections](orthogonal_projections), apply [QR Factorization](qr_factorization), etc. Roughly speaking, 
an inner product space behaves like $\bbr^n$ as far as addition, scalar multiplication, and the dot product are concerned.

More precisely, we say an **inner product** in a linear space $V$ is a rule that assigns a real scalar (denoted by 
$\langle \;f, g \rangle$) to any pair $f, g$ of elements of $V$, such that the following properties hold for all $f, g, h$ 
in $V$, and all $c$ in $\bbr$:

1. $\iprod{\;f}{g} = \iprod{g}{\;f}$,
2. $\iprod{\;f+h}{g} =\iprod{\;f}{g} + \iprod{h}{g}$,
3. $\iprod{cf}{g} = c\iprod{\;f}{g}$, and
4. $\iprod{\;f}{\;f} > 0$, for all nonzero $\;f$ in $V$.

A linear space endowed with an inner product is called an **inner product space**.

## Norm

The **norm** (or magnitude) of an element $\;f$ of an inner product space is

$$ \norm{\;f} = \sqrt{\iprod{\;f}{\;f}}\text{.} $$

</section>

## Orthogonality

Two elements $\;f$ and $g$ of an inner product space are called **orthogonal** (or perpendicular) if

$$ \iprod{\;f}{g} = 0\text{.} $$

## Distance

We define the **distance** between two elements of an inner product space as the norm of their difference:

$$ \text{dist}(\;f, g) = \norm{\;f - g}\text{.} $$

# Complex Inner Product

When working with vectors of complex numbers, we work with a slightly modified inner product. Note commutativity and
scalar multiplication is not quite correct as defined in the above [summary](summary) unless consider the real subset
$\bbr$ of $\bbc$. That is, we define the **inner product** of two vectors having the same number of components, by
$$ (\pmb{x}, \pmb{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\overline{y}_i = \pmb{x}^T\overline{\pmb{y}}.\; $$

From this, it follows that

1. $(\pmb{x}, \pmb{y}) = \overline{(\pmb{y}, \pmb{x})},$
2. $(\pmb{x}, \pmb{y} + \pmb{z}) = (\pmb{x}, \pmb{y}) + (\pmb{x }, \pmb{z}),$
3. $(\alpha\pmb{x}, \pmb{y}) = \alpha(\pmb{x}, \pmb{y}),$
4. $(\pmb{x}, \alpha\pmb{y}) + \overline{\alpha}(\pmb{x}, \pmb{y}).$

The norm and orthogonality are described in the same way as the generalized inner product space.
