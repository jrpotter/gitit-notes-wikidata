# Summary

![Example Band](/img/diagrams/calculus/surface-band.png)

The surface of revolution is the surface obtained by rotating a function around some axis (not necessarily the
standard ones). Often times, we are interested in determining the surface area of this surface, though generally
speaking we are interested in the system of parametric equations involved with creating said surface. 

The area of a surface of revolution can be derived by the surface area of a *band*, as generated by a smaller cone 
removed from a larger one. The lateral height of this band can be taken to be the [arc length](arc_length) of a given 
curve, made arbitrarily precise by increasing the number of polygonal approximations along said curve.

# Surface Area Formula

<section class="secondary">

## Cartesian Equations

Given a positive $f$ with a continuous derivative, the **surface area** of the surface obtained by rotating
the curve $y = f(x), a \leq x \leq b$, about the $x$-axis is defined as 
$$ S = \int_a^b2\pi f(x)\sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2}dx\text{.} $$

<div class="proof">

We note the lateral surface area of a cone is $A = \pi rl$ and thus the surface area of a band, which
we consider to be a lower segment of a cone, is $A = \pi l(r_1+r_2)$, where $r_i$ is the base radius of the
smaller and larger cone respectively (the band's area can be found by similar triangles between the slant heights
and radii of both cones).

So given a surface obtained by rotating a curve $y=f(x), a\leq x \leq b$, about the $x$-axis, where
$f$ is positive and has a continuous derivative, we can approximate the curve itself in the same manner
as the arc length, and rotating this approximation yields a series of bands, as defined above, with slant
height $\left|P_{i-1}P_i\right|$.

Thus the area of any given band is $$ 2\pi\frac{y_{i-1}+y_i}{2}\left|P_{i-1}P_i\right|\text{.} $$ 
By the proof of Theorem 8.1.2, $$ \left|P_{i-1}P_i\right| = \sqrt{1+[f'(x_i^*)]^2}\Delta{x} $$ 
where $x_i^*$ is some number in $[x_{i-1},x_i]$. When $\Delta{x}$ is small, both $y_i$ and $y_{i-1}$ are approximately 
$f(x_i^*)$, since $f$ is continuous. Therefore 
$$ 2\pi\frac{y_{i-1}+y_i}{2}\left|P_{i-1}P_i\right| \approx 2\pi f(x_i^*)\sqrt{1+[f'(x_i^*)]^2}\Delta{x} $$
and so an approximation to the area is $$ \sum_{i=1}^n2\pi f(x_i^*)\sqrt{1+[f'(x_i^*)]^2}\Delta{x}\text{.} $$

This approximation becomes better as $n\rightarrow\infty$, which we recognize as a Riemann sum for the
function $g(x) = 2\pi f(x)\sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2}$, completing the proof. As a note, we can consider
the formula to represent the summation of circumferences of circles with radius $f(x)$ along the curve.

## Parametric Equations

If the curve given by the parametric equations $x = f(t), y = g(t), \alpha \leq t \leq \beta$, is rotated about the 
$x$-axis, where $f', g'$ are continuous and $g(t) \geq 0$, then the area of the resulting surface is given by 
$$ S = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta}2\pi y\sqrt{[f'(t)]^2 + [g'(t)]^2}dt. $$

# Parametric Surfaces

<div class="block">

![Revolution Diagram](/img/diagrams/calculus/surface-of-revolution-parametric.png)

To form a surface of revolution (not necessarily to compute its surface area), we can consider a parametric system of
two variables. For instance, consider the surface $S$ obtained by rotating the curve $y = f(x)$, $a \leq x \leq b$,
about the $x$-axis (other axes handled similarly), where $f(x) \geq 0$. Let $\theta$ be the angle of rotation formed
by some point $P(x, y, z)$ on $f(x)$ and the $xy$-plane. Then
$$ x = x, \quad y = f(x)\cos{\theta}, \quad z = f(x)\sin{\theta}. $$
Therefore, we can take $x$ and $\theta$ as the parameters and regard the above as the parametric equations of $S$
where the parameter domain is given by $a \leq x \leq b$, $0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$.
