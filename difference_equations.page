# Summary

Difference equations are the discrete analogue of differential equations. An equation is called a **first order difference 
equation** if the next value of the equation is equal to a function applied to the previous value of the equation as follows:
$$ y_{n+1} = f(n, y_n), \quad n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots $$
A **solution** of the difference equation is a sequence of numbers $y_0, y_1, y_2, \ldots$ that satisfy the equation for each $n$,
which may be described by an initial condition $$ y_0 = \alpha $$
that prescribes the value of the first term of the solution sequence.
