![Cosets of $(\bbz/8\bbz, +)$](/img/diagrams/abstract/cosets-z8z.png)

Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$. The subset $aH = \{ah : h \in H\}$ of $G$ is the **left coset** of
$H$ containing $a$, while the subset $Ha = \{ha : h \in H\}$ is the **right coset** of $H$ containing $a$.
Furthermore, note that each subset, while not equivalent to one another, do form equivalence classes; that is,
$aH$ is equal to $bH$ if $b \in aH$. The same applies for right cosets.

<div class="proof">

Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Let the relation $\text{~}_L$ be defined on $G$ by $a~\text{~}_L~ b$ if and only if $a^{-1}b \in H$.
Similarly, define the relation $\text{~}_R$ be defined on $G$ by $a~\text{~}_R~ b$ if and only if $ab^{-1} \in H$.
We will prove that $\text{~}_L$ is an equivalence relation, with the understanding that $\text{~}_R$ is proven similarly.

- *Reflexive:* 
    Let $a \in G$. Then $a^{-1}a = e$ and $e \in H$ since $H$ is a subgroup. Thus $a~\text{~}_L~a$.
- *Symmetric:* 
    Suppose $a~\text{~}_L~b$. Then $a^{-1}b \in H$. Since $H$ is a subgroup, $(a^{-1}b)^{-1}$ is in $H$
    meaning $b^{-1}a$ is in $H$ so $b~\text{~}_L~a$.
- *Transitive:* 
    Let $a~\text{~}_L~b$ and $b~\text{~}_L~c$. Then $a^{-1}b \in H$ and $b^{-1}c \in H$. Since $H$ is a subgroup,
    $(a^{-1}b)(b^{-1}c) = a^{-1}c$ is in $H$, so $a~\text{~}_L~c$.

Now suppose that $a \in G$. Then the cell containing $a$ consists of all $x \in G$ such that $a~\text{~}_L~x$
meaning $a^{-1}x \in H$. This holds only if for some $h \in H$, $x = ah$. Thus the cell containing $a$ is
$\{ah : h \in H\}$.

# Indices

If $H$ is a subgroup of a group $G$, the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$ is the **index $(G:H)$ of 
$H$ in $G$**. Furthermore, if $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of a group $G$ such that $K \leq H \leq G$, and
$(H:K)$ and $(G:H)$ are both finite, then $(G:K)$ is finite, and $(G:K) = (G:H)(H:K)$.

<div class="proof">

Note that 
$$ 
  (G:K) = \frac{\big|G\big|}{\big|K\big|},\; 
  (G:H) = \frac{\big|G\big|}{\big|H\big|}, \text{ and }
  (H:K) = \frac{\big|H\big|}{\big|K\big|}.
$$
The theorem follows.
