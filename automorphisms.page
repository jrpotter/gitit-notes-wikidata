# Summary

An isomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow G$ of a group $G$ with itself is an **automorphism** of $G$. The automorphism
$i_g : G \rightarrow G$, where $i_g(x) = gxg^{-1}$ for all $x \in G$, is the **inner automorphism of $G$ by $g$**.
Performing $i_g$ on $x$ is called **conjugation of $x$ by $g$**.
We see therefore that if $i_g[H] = H$, then we again have a normal subgroup (by Property 1 of 
[alternative characterizations](#alternative-characterizations)). Otherwise, a subgroup $K$ of $G$ is called a
**conjugate subgroup** of $H$ if $K = i_g[H]$ for some $g \in G$.
