![Separable Equation Example](/img/graphs/diffeq/integral-curves-separable.png)

The method of separable equations is a direct integration method used to solve a special type of nonlinear equations.
Given a general first order equation $y' = f(x, y)$, we can rewrite the equation as
$$ M(x, y) + N(x, y) \leibniz[y]{x} = 0. $$
Note this is always possible by setting $M(x, y) = -f(x, y)$ and $N(x, y) = 1$, though other possibilities may exist.
If it happens that $M$ is a function of $x$ only and $N$ is a function of $y$ only, then the above equation reduces to
$$ M(x) + N(y)\leibniz[y]{x} = 0. $$
Such an equation is said to be **separable** since it can be written in differential form
$$ M(x)dx + N(y)dy = 0, $$
where terms involving each variable may be placed on opposite sides of the equation.

<div class="proof">

Note that the separable form is merely a convenience, meant to emphasize how integration should take place;
namely with respect to the differential attached to either $M(x)$ or $N(y)$. To demonstrate, note that
$$ M(x) + N(y)\leibniz[y]{x} = 0 $$
means that, by $u$-substitution,
$$\begin{align*} 
  N(y)\leibniz[y]{x} &= -M(x)                    \\
  \int N(y) \leibniz[y]{x}\;dx &= -\int M(x)\;dx \\
  \int N(y)\;dy &= -\int M(x)\;dx                \\
  \int M(x)\;dx + \int N(y)\;dy &= 0.
\end{align*}$$
Therefore integrating with respect to this differential form, which is relatively nonsensical without the proper machinery,
can nonetheless be used as shorthand for the above process.

# Solutions

The general solution then, defined implicitly, is
$$ \int_{x_0}^x M(s)\;ds + \int_{y_0}^y N(s)\;ds = 0, $$
where $x_0$ and $y_0$ are the given initial values.

<div class="proof">

Let $H_1$ and $H_2$ be the antiderivatives as defined in the [proof](#summary) of separable equations. We found that
$$ H_1(x) + H_2(y) = C, $$
where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. Now our initial conditions state that
$$ y(x_0) = y_0 $$
which we can solve by setting $x = x_0$ and $y = y_0$ in the equation above.
Therefore
$$ C = H_1(x_0) + H_2(y_0). $$
Then
$$ H_1(x) + H_2(y) = H_1(x_0) + H_2(y_0) $$
and we find that
$$ H_1(x) - H_1(x_0) = \int_{x_0}^x M(s)\;ds \;\text{ and }\; H_2(y) - H_2(y_0) = \int_{y_0}^y N(s)\;ds. $$
