When exploring integration in higher dimensions, we can perform the technique of iterated integrals - evaluating
integrals that are nested deeper first and working outward, keeping variables constant if we are not integrating with
respect to them. This is very similar to the idea of [partial differentiation](partial_derivatives),and, as such, we'd
expect a similar concept to arise that parallels [Clairaut's Theorem](clairauts_theorem).

Fubini's Theorem does tell us that integrating over a rectangular region can be done in any order. For geometric intuition,
we consider finding the volume of the area underneath a curve $z = f(x, y)$. We note it should not matter what the cross-sections
we integrate over is; and thus the order in which we integrate should be independent of the volume.

More specifically, if $\;f$ is continuous on the rectangle $R = \{(x, y) : a \leq x \leq b, c \leq y \leq d\}$, then
$$ \iint_R f(x, y)dA = \int_a^b \int_c^d f(x, y)dy dx = \int_c^d \int_a^b f(x, y)dx dy. $$
Generally speaking, the above is true if we assume that $\;f$ is bounded on $R$, $\;f$ is discontinuous only on a finite
number of smooth curves, and the iterated integrals exist.
