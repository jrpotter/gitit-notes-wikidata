Computation Theory is a subject focused on the computability, or lack thereof, of certain problems and the minimal constructs
needed to come to a solution. It follows a progression of language complexity, from regular languages to context-free grammars,
and lastly to unrestricted grammars which we see correspond to finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines
respectively. Though attempted, a more general computer has not yet been found- it seems the Turing machine represents
a semblance of stability in the necessary components of a computer.

In addition, computation theory focuses on what problems are and are not computable, as well as the classification of
algorithms used to solve certain types of problems. For instance, any polynomial-time algorithm can be rendered as
the computation of the closure of a set under some relations of fixed arity.

Lastly, an emphasis on efficiency is placed when computing a problem (e.g. the infamous $P \neq NP$). It is undetermined as to 
whether certain problems can be solved faster (such as the Traveling Salesman Problem), but the search for some conclusion
remains a leading area of research, despite the lack of answers hitherto.
