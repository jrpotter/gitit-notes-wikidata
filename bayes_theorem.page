# Summary

Bayes' Theorem allows one to reason off the occurrence of some condition, as opposed to an event itself.
More specifically, let $\inflate{F}{n}$ be mutually exclusive, exhaustive events. Then given event $E$,
$$
  \bbps{F_j \;|\; E} = \frac{\bbps{EF_j}}{\bbps{E}}
                     = \frac{\bbps{E \;|\; F_j}\bbps{F_j}}{\sum_{i=1}^n \bbps{E \;|\; F_i}\bbps{F_i}}.
$$
