![Division Algorithm](/img/diagrams/abstract/division-algorithm.png)

Though very basic, the division algorithm is fundamental in understanding periodicity in groups in $\bbz$ and otherwise
(such as polynomial groups). It is expressed in $\bbz$ exactly as one might expect: if $m$ is a positive integer and $n$ is 
any integer, then there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that
$$ n = mq + r \quad \text{ and }\quad 0 \leq r < m. $$

<div class="proof">

On the real $x$-axis of analytic geometry, mark off the multiples of $m$ and the position of $n$. Now $n$ falls
either on a multiple $qm$ of $m$ and $r$ can be taken as $0$, or $n$ falls between two multiples of $m$. If the
latter is the case, let $qm$ be the first multiple of $m$ to the left of $n$. Then $r$ is as shown in the
diagram above. Note that $0 \leq r < m$ as expected. Uniqueness of $q$ and $r$ follows since if $n$ is not
a multiple of $m$ so that we can take $r = 0$, then there is a unique multiple $qm$ of $m$ to the left of $n$
and at distance less than $m$ from $n$, also illustrated above.

# Ring Polynomials

Let $$ f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 $$ and $$ g(x) = b_mx^m + b_{m-1}x^{m-1} + \cdots + b_0 $$
be two elements of $F[x]$, with $a_n$ and $b_m$ both nonzero elements of $F$ and $m > 0$. Then there are unique
polynomials $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ in $F[x]$ such that $f(x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x)$, where either $r(x) = 0$ or the degree
of $r(x)$ is less than the degree $m$ of $g(x)$.

<div class="proof">

Consider the set $S = \{ f(x) - g(x)s(x) : s(x) \in F[X] \}$, which we can regard as the set of solutions. For instance,
and as our first case, suppose $0 \in S$. Then there exists an $s(x) \in F[x]$ such that $f(x) - g(x)s(x) = 0$, implying
$f(x) = g(x)s(x)$. Taking $q(x) = s(x)$ and $r(x) = 0$, we are finished.
Otherwise, let $r(x)$ be an element of minimal degree in $S$. That is, $r(x)$ has a degree that is as small as possible.
Then we expect $f(x)$ to take on form $$ f(x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x) $$ for some $q(x) \in F[x]$. All that remains is showing
that the degree of $r(x)$ is less than $m$. Suppose then, for the sake of contradiction, that
$$ r(x) = c_tx^t + c_{t-1}x^{t-1} + \cdots + c_0, $$
with $c_j \in F$, $c_t \neq 0$, and $t \geq m$. Then it follows that
$$ f(x) - g(x)q(x) - (c_t/b_m)x^{t-m}g(x) = r(x) - (c_t/b_m)x^{t-m}g(x). $$
Because $g(x)$ is of order $m$, we see the right hand side is of the form
$$ r(x) - (c_tx^t + \text{terms of lower degree}), $$
which is a polynomial of degree lower than $t$. Yet the right hand side evaluates to
$$ f(x) - g(x)\left[q(x) + (c_t/b_m)x^{t-m}\right], $$
which is in $S$. The contradiction becomes clear when we rewrite the polynomial as
$$ f(x) = g(x)\left[q(x) + (c_t/b_m)x^{t-m}\right] + \left[r(x) - (c_t/b_m)x^{t-m}g(x)\right], $$
namely that we started with the assumption that $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ were solutions with $r(x)$ with minimal degree,
but we have found another solution with a remainder that has a smaller degree than $r(x)$. Thus the degree of $r(x)$
is less than the degree $m$ of $g(x)$.

*****

For uniqueness, if $$ f(x) = g(x)q_1(x) + r_1(x) $$ and $$ f(x) = g(x)q_2(x) + r_2(x), $$ then subtracting we have
$$ g(x)[q_1(x) - q_2(x)] = r_2(x) - r_1(x). $$ We note either $r_2(x) - r_1(x) = 0$ or the degree of $r_2(x) - r_1(x)$
is less than the degree of $g(x)$. Since these two evaluations are equal, $q_1(x) - q_2(x)$ must drive $g(x)$ to a
lower degree, which can only happen if it equals zero. Therefore $q_1(x) = q_2(x)$, which implies that $r_2(x) - r_1(x) = 0$
and so $r_1(x) = r_2(x)$.
