Newton's method is an approximating means of finding roots of an equation that are difficult to find otherwise. By employing a
sequence of [linearizations](tangent_lines#linearization), one can get closer and closer to the true value of a root. Note
though this can be difficult to approximate- taking too small of steps for subsequent linearizations may take much too long,
and taking too large of steps can yield oscillating patterns of lines or even divergent sequences.

Given an initial point $x_1$, close to the root $r$ we are trying to find, we can hope the tangent line at $f(x_1)$ intersects 
the $x$-axis closer to $r$, yielding $x_2$. In general, we have 
$$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \;\text{ and hope that }\; \xlimit{n}{\infty}x_n = r. $$

<div class="proof">

Consider a point $x_1$ close to $r$. Its tangent line is $$ y - f(x_1) = f'(x_1)(x - x_1), $$ which intersects the $x$-axis 
when $y = 0$. Thus $$ 0 - f(x) = f'(x_1)(x-x_1) $$ implying $$ x = x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)}, $$ which we label $x_2$. 
We repeat this process indefinitely, in the hopes of reaching $r$ as $$ \xlimit{n}{\infty}x_n. $$
