Consider two $n\times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$. We say that $A$ is **similar** to $B$ if there exists an
invertible matrix $S$ such that $AS = SB$. Thus two matrices are similar if they represent the same linear
transformation with respect to different bases. Additionally, we note similarity is an equivalence relation, 
which makes sense considering the change of basis matrices are similar, and we would like to ensure that our choice
of basis is independent of any final results we are seeking.

<div class="proof">

Let $A, B$, and $C$ be similar $n\times n$ matrices.

- Reflexive
:    Consider the identity matrix, an invertible $n\times n$ matrix. Note $AI_n = I_nA$ so
     $A$ is similar to itself.
- Symmetric
:    Suppose there exists an invertible matrix $S$ such that $AS = SB$. Then
     $B = S^{-1}AS \Rightarrow BS^{-1} = S^{-1}A$.
- Transitive
:    Suppose there exist invertible matrices $P$ and $Q$ such that $AP = PB$ and $BQ = QC$.
     Then $$ AP = PQCQ^{-1} \Rightarrow APQ = PQC \Rightarrow AS = SC $$ where $S = PQ$ is invertible.

# Eigenvalues

Suppose matrix $A$ is similar to $B$. Then

1. Matrices $A$ and $B$ have the same [characteristic polynomial](eigenvectors#characteristic-polynomial), 
   that is, $f_A(\lambda) = f_B(\lambda)$.<br />  
   <div class="proof">
   If $B = S^{-1}AS$, then 
   $$\begin{align*}
     f_B(\lambda) &= \text{det}(B-\lambda I_n)                                    \\
                  &= \text{det}(S^{-1}AS-\lambda I_n)                             \\
                  &= \text{det}(S^{-1}(A-\lambda I_n)S)                           \\
                  &= (\text{det}\;S)^{-1}\text{det}(A-\lambda I_n)\text{det}(S)   \\
                  &= (\text{det}\;S)^{-1}(\text{det}\;S)\text{det}(A-\lambda I_n) \\
                  &= f_A(\lambda)
   \end{align*}$$
   for all scalars $\lambda$.
   </div><br />

2. $\text{rank}(A) = \text{rank}(B)$ and $\text{nullity}(A) = \text{nullity}(B)$.<br />  
   <div class="proof">
   First note that $A$ and $B$ are $n \times n$ matrices and therefore $\text{dim}\;A = \text{dim}\;B = n$.
   Now consider $B = S^{-1}AS$ or $SB = AS$. The kernel of $B$ consists of all vectors $\vec{x}$ such that
   $$ S(B\vec{x}) = S\vec{0} = \vec{0} = AS\vec{x} = A(S\vec{x}). $$
   Thus, $S\vec{x}$ is in the kernel of $A$. Given this, consider the transformation $T(\vec{x}) = S\vec{x}$
   from $\text{ker}\;B$ to $\text{ker}\;A$. Since $S$ is invertible, $\text{ker}\;T = \{\vec{0}\}$ and
   $\text{im}\;T = \text{ker}\;A$. Therefore $T$ is an isomorphism.
   Supposing $\inflate{\;f}{m}$ is the basis of $\text{ker}\;B$, we note that $T(f_1), T(f_2), \ldots, T(f_m)$
   is a basis of $A$[^1] meaning $\text{nullity}\;B = \text{nullity}\;A$. By the 
   [rank-nullity theorem](dimensions#rank-nullity-theorem), $\text{rank}\;B = \text{rank}\;A$.
   </div><br />

3. Matrices $A$ and $B$ have the same eigenvalues, with the same algebraic and geometric multiplicities.<br />  
   <div class="proof">
   From part $(1)$ we see that matrices $A$ and $B$ have the same eigenvalues, with the same algebraic multiplicities.
   For geometric multiplicity, we argue that $A - \lambda I_n$ is similar to $B - \lambda I_n$ for all $\lambda$.
   This follows because
   $$\begin{align*}
     A - \lambda I_n &= S^{-1}BS - \lambda I_n     \\
                     &= S^{-1}(BS - S\lambda I_n)  \\
                     &= S^{-1}(BS - \lambda I_n S) \\
                     &= S^{-1}(B - \lambda I_n)S.
   \end{align*}$$
   Then part $(2)$ tells us the nullity of $A - \lambda I_n$ is that of $B - \lambda I_n$ for all eigenvalues $\lambda$.
   </div><br />

4. Matrices $A$ and $B$ have the same determinant and the same trace.<br />  
   <div class="proof">
   This follows from the fact that the characteristic polynomials are the same by part $(1)$, so the trace and determinant
   coefficients are also the same, up to signs.[^2]
