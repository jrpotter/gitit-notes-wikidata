To visualize [generating sets](generating_sets), we employ the use of **Cayley Graphs** which consist of
a set of arcs, corresponding to elements of a generating set, pointing to another element of the set. Note
the graph is directed, and following an arc is the same as applying a given element by the element the
arc represents *on the right*. Since in a group, going backwards along an arc represents multiplying on
the right by the inverse of the arc. The one exception tends to be elements that are their own inverses;
these are usually denoted by a dashed line with no arrowhead.

Every group has a digraph with the following necessary properties (and, conversely, every digraph
with these properties are by necessity a group):

1. The digraph is connected.
2. At most one arc goes from a vertex $g$ to a vertex $h$.
3. Each vertex $g$ has exactly one arc of each type starting at $g$, and one of each type
   ending at $g$.
4. If two different sequences of arc types starting from vertex $g$ lead to the same vertex $h$,
   then those same sequences of arc types starting from any vertex $u$ will lead to the same vertex
   $v$.

<div class="proof">

1. Every equation $gx = h$ has a solution in a group.
2. The solution of $gx = h$ is unique.
3. For $g \in G$ and each generator $b$ we can compute $gb$, and $(gb^{-1})b = g$.
4. If $gq = h$ and $gr = h$, then $uq = ug^{-1}h = ur$.
