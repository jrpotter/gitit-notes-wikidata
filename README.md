Gitit-Notes-Wikidata
====================

[Version 1.0.0 - 12/15/2015]

Wikidata for the [gitit-notes](https://github.com/jrpotter/gitit-notes) repo. I have broken up the git repo linked earlier into
a separate repository such that anyone can download the wikidata content recursively when pulling from gitit-notes. Though
one can simply view these files separately, I have provided various plugins in the gitit-notes repo that would make viewing
much more enjoyable, so please refer to that for actual rendering of MathJax and some custom blocks.
