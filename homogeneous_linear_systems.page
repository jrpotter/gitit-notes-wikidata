# Summary

For simplicity, we choose to work with a system of first order linear equations that satisfy the constraints to ensure 
[existence and uniqueness](system_of_first_order_linear_equations#existence-and-uniqueness). In particular, 
if each of the functions $g_1(t), \ldots, g_n(t)$ is zero for all $t$ in the interval $I$, then we say the system is 
**homogeneous**. A system of homogeneous equations can be solved very similarly to just a single homogeneous equation,
and solutions/theorems parallel the single equation theory. In particular, we rewrite the system as
$$ \pmb{x}' = \pmb{P}(t), $$ and note that nonhomogeneous solutions follow after solving the corresponding homogeneous
equations.

# Principle of Superposition

Paralleling the concept of [superposition](homogeneous_equations#principle-of-superposition) of single homogeneous equations,
we find that if the vector functions $\pmb{x}^{(1)}$ and $\pmb{x}^{(2)}$ are solutions of the homogeneous system, then the
linear combination $c_1\pmb{x}^{(1)} + c_2\pmb{x}^{(2)}$ is also a solution for any constants $c_1$ and $c_2$.

<div class="proof">

We simply evaluate both the left and right hand sides of the system $\pmb{x}' = \pmb{P}(t)\pmb{x}$. The left hand side is
$$ \left[c_1\pmb{x}^{(1)} + c_2\pmb{x}^{(2)}\right]' = c_1(\pmb{x}^{(1)})' + c_2(\pmb{x}^{(2)})'. $$
Similarly, the right hand side is
$$\begin{align*}
  P(t)\left[c_1\pmb{x}^{(1)} + c_2\pmb{x}^{(2)}\right] &= c_1P(t)\pmb{x}^{(1)} + c_2P(t)\pmb{x}^{(2)} \\
                                                       &= c_1(\pmb{x}^{(1)})' + c_2(\pmb{x}^{(2)})'.
\end{align*}$$
