Abstract Algebra is the subject related to algebraic structures and the properties derived from said structures (e.g. 
[groups](#group-theory) and [rings]()). Namely, a large focus is set on identifying properties inherent in
these structures, and being able to determine isomorphic constructs to help simplify solving problems. In essence,
rather than focusing on numbers of some specified domain, we abstract the idea to any set of elements that can behave
in a manner similar to numbers over any domain.

Abstract algebra is particularly prevalent in computer science, such as throughout cryptography and in different
functional programming paradigms (such as monads, monoids, etc.). It also enables generalizations of transformations
such as on $GL_2(\bbr)$, the group of $2 \times 2$ invertible matrices with real values, which often time represent
an actual action on a set of data. It even enables combinatoric arguments (namely through Burnside's Lemma). As such, 
despite its name, many applications arise from group, ring, and field theory for use outside of pure mathematics.
