![TNB Frame](/img/diagrams/calculus/tnb-frame.png)

The **TNB Frames** (**t**angent, **n**ormal, and **b**inormal vectors) of a function describe said function completely along its 
curve. Note each vector in the frame are orthogonal to each other, which makes intuitive sense as these vectors form a
three-dimensional "coordinate" grid at a point.

We note first that the **unit tangent vector** or $\pmb{T}(t)$ is the vector tangent to a curve at point $t$ with length
$1$. This vector describes the direction of the curve at a given moment in time, and is calculated as follows:
$$ \pmb{T}(t) = \frac{\pmb{r}'(t)}{\left|\pmb{r}'(t)\right|}. $$

Orthogonal to this vector and pointing in the direction the curve is moving is the **principal unit normal vector**, 
$\pmb{N}(t)$, calculated by $$ \pmb{N}(t) = \frac{\pmb{T}'(t)}{\left|\pmb{T}'(t)\right|}. $$

Lastly, the **binormal vector**, which is the vector perpendicular to both $\pmb{T}$ and $\pmb{N}$ is calculated by
$$ \pmb{B}(t) = \pmb{T}(t) \times \pmb{N}(t) $$
and is also a unit vector.

# Normal Vector

We note the two properties of a normal vector (orthogonality and direction) follows from the following two facts:

1. If $\left|\pmb{r}(t)\right| = c$ (a constant), then $\pmb{r}'(t)$ is orthogonal to $\pmb{r}(t)$ for all $t$.<br />  
   <div class="proof">
   Since 
   $$ \pmb{r}(t) \cdot \pmb{r}(t) = \left|\pmb{r}(t)\right|^2 = c^2 $$
   and $c^2$ is a constant, then
   $$ 
     0 = \leibniz{t}[\pmb{r}(t)\cdot\pmb{r}(t)] 
       = \pmb{r}'(t)\cdot\pmb{r}(t) + \pmb{r}(t)\cdot\pmb{r}'(t) 
       = 2(\pmb{r}'(t) \cdot \pmb{r}(t)). 
   $$
   Thus $\pmb{r}'(t) \cdot \pmb{r}(t) = 0$, meaning $\pmb{r}'(t)$ is orthogonal to $\pmb{r}(t)$.
   </div><br />

2. The second derivative of a space curve points towards the direction the curve is bending towards.<br />  
   <div class="proof">
   Consider the projections onto the $x$, $y$, and $z$ planes of the curve. This amounts to looking at
   the components of the space curve separately. We note the second derivative of a function corresponds
   to the concavity of the curve; that is, if the function is concave upward, the second derivative is
   positive. Likewise, it the function is concave downward, the second derivative is negative. Thus, the
   second derivative of the vector function must satisfy this property for each of the component functions
   of the space curve, meaning it points towards the direction the curve is bending towards.
   </div><br />

The normal vector is unique since there is only one such unit vector that satisfies both these properties: the
vector that is orthogonal to the tangent unit vector and points towards the center of the osculating circle
at the given point.

# Planes

<div class="block">

![Osculating Circle](/img/diagrams/calculus/osculating-circle.png)

The plane determined by the normal and binormal vectors $\pmb{N}$ and $\pmb{B}$ at a point $P$ on the curve
$C$ is called the **normal plane** of $C$ at $P$. This is the plane with normal vector $\pmb{T}$ and vectors
$\pmb{N}$ and $\pmb{B}$ in the plane.

The plane determined by the vectors $\pmb{T}$ and $\pmb{N}$ is called the **osculating plane** of $C$ at $P$. This
is the plane with normal vector $\pmb{B}$ and the vectors $\pmb{T}$ and $\pmb{N}$ in the plane. 

The circle that lies in the osculating place of $C$ at $P$, has the same tangent as $C$ at $P$, lies on the concave 
side of $C$ (toward which $\pmb{N}$ points), and has radius $\rho = 1/\kappa$ is called the **osculating circle** of $C$ 
at $P$. It is the circle that best describes how $C$ behaves near $P$; it shares the same tangent, normal, and 
[curvature](curvature) at $P$.
