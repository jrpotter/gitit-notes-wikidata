# Summary

Every bounded sequence of $\bbr$ contains a convergent subsequence. This is a very powerful result, in particular because of
its use in the [Cauchy Criterion](cauchy_sequences#cauchy-criterion).

<div class="proof">

Let $(a_n)$ be a bounded sequence so that there exists $M > 0$ satisfying $\abs{a_n} \leq M$ for all $n \in \bbn$.
Bisect the closed interval $[-M, M]$ into the two closed intervals $[-M, 0]$ and $[0, M]$. Now, it must be that
at least one of these closed intervals contains an infinite number of the points in the sequence $(a_n)$. Select a
half for which this is the case and label that interval as $I_1$. Then, let $a_{n_1}$ be some point in the sequence
$(a_n)$ satisfying $a_{n_1} \in I_1$.

We repeat this process again, constructing $I_2$ and selecting an $a_{n_2}$ from the original sequence with
$n_2 > n_1$ and $a_{n_2} \in I_2$. In general, we construct the closed interval $I_k$ by taking a half of
$I_{k-1}$ containing an infinite number of points of $(a_n)$ and then selecting $n_k > n_{k-1} > \cdots n_1$
so that $a_{n_k} \in I_k$.

We now claim that $(a_{n_k})$ is a convergent subsequence that converges to $x \in \bigcap_{i=1}^\infty I_k$, which
we note exists since the [Nested Interval Property](nested_interval_property) applies. Let $\epsilon > 0$. By
construction, the length of $I_k$ is $M(1/2)^{k-1}$ which converges to zero. Choose $N$ so that $k \geq N$ implies
that the length of $I_k$ is less than $\epsilon$. Because $x$ and $a_{n_k}$ are both in $I_k$, it follows that
$\abs{a_{n_k} - x} < \epsilon$.
