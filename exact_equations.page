# Summary

Another class of first order equations that are neither [linear](integrating_factors) nor [separable](separable_equations)
are **exact equations**. That is, it can be written in a form represented by the partials of some function $\psi$ of $x$ 
and $y$ such that $$ \leibniz{x} \psi[x, \phi(x)] $$ where $\phi(x) = y$. More precisely, let the functions $M$, $N$, $M_y$, 
and $N_x$, where subscripts denote partial derivatives, be continuous in a simply-connected region 
$R$. Then a differential equation in the form
$$ M(x, y) + N(x, y)y' = 0 $$
is an exact differential equation in $R$ if and only if
$$ M_y(x, y) = N_x(x, y) $$
at each point of $R$.
