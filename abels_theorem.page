# Summary

If $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions of the differential equation $L[y]$ where $p$ and $q$ are continuous on an open interval
$I$, then the Wronskian $W(y_1, y_2)(t)$ is given by $$ W(y_1, y_2)(t) = c\exp\left[-\int p(t)\;dt\right], $$
where $c$ is a certain constant that depends on $y_1$ and $y_2$, but not on $t$. Further, $W(y_1, y_2)(t)$ either
is zero for all $t$ in $I$ (if $c = 0$) or else is never zero in $I$ (if $c \neq 0$).

<div class="proof">

We start by noting that $y_1$ and $y_2$ satisfy
$$\begin{align*}
  y_1'' + p(t)y_1' + q(t)y_1 &= 0, \\
  y_2'' + p(t)y_2' + q(t)y_2 &= 0.
\end{align*}$$
Then multiplying the first equation by $-y_2$ and the second by $y_1$, then adding the resulting equations, we obtain
$$ (y_1y_2'' - y_1''y_2) + p(t)(y_1y_2' - y_1'y_2) = 0. $$ Observing that $W' = y_1y_2'' - y_1''y_2$, we can write
$$ W' + p(t)W = 0. $$ Solving the above [separable equation](separable_equation) we see that
$$ W(t) = c\exp{\left[-\int p(t)\;dt\right]}, $$ where $c$ is a constant. Here we note that the Wronskian is zero only
if $c = 0$, proving our desired result.
