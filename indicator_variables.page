# Summary

Often times **indicator variables** are employed in the context of expected value. We say that $I$ is an indicator variable 
for the event $A$ if
$$
  I = \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{if } A \text{ occurs} \\
    0 &\text{if } A^c \text{ occurs}
  \end{cases}
$$
Indicator variables may seem very simple, but prove to be very powerful. Oftentimes they are used to represent a series
of Bernoulli trials (that is, those that either pass or fail) in a manner that is simple to manipulate.
