A second order linear equation is said to by **homogeneous** if the term $g(t)$ in
$$ y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = g(t), $$
is $0$ for all $t$. Otherwise the equation is called **nonhomogeneous**. If we can solve a homogeneous equation, then
it is always possible to solve the corresponding nonhomogeneous equation (or at least express it in terms of an integral).
When discussing general properties of linear differential equations, differential operation notation is introduced. More
precisely, let $p$ and $q$ be continuous functions on an open interval $I$. Then, for any function $\phi$ that is twice
differentiable on $I$, the differential operator $L$ is defined by
$$ L[\phi] = \phi'' + p\phi' + q\phi $$
and the value of $L[\phi]$ at a point $t$ is
$$ L[\phi](t) = \phi''(t) + p(t)\phi'(t) + q(t)\phi(t). $$

# Existence and Uniqueness

Consider the initial value problem
$$ y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = g(t), \quad y(t_0) = y_0, \quad y'(t_0) = y'_0, $$
where $p$, $q$, and $g$ are continuous on an open interval $I$ that contains the point $t_0$. Then there is exactly one solution
$y = \phi(t)$ of this problem, and the solution exists throughout the interval $I$. Note the above is written in the form of
a nonhomogeneous equation (though of course this includes homogeneous equations).

# Principle of Superposition

If $y_1$ and $y_2$ are two solutions of the differential equation
$$ L[y] = y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = 0 $$
then the linear combination $c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$ is also a solution for any values of the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$.

<div class="proof">

Note that
$$\begin{align*}
  L[c_1y_1 + c_2y_2] &= [c_1y_1 + c_2y_2]'' + p[c_1y_1 + c_2y_2]' + q[c_1y_1 + c_2y_2] \\
                     &= c_1y_1'' + c_2y_2'' + c_1py_1' + c_2py_2' + c_1qy_1 + c_2qy_2  \\
                     &= c_1[y_1'' + py_1' + qy_1] + c_2[y_2'' + py_2' + qy_2]          \\
                     &= c_1L[y_1] + c_2L[y_2]. 
\end{align*}$$
Since $L[y_1] = 0$ and $L[y_2] = 0$, the proof follows.
