![Generating Sets of $S_3$](/img/diagrams/abstract/generating-sets-s3.png)

We can generalize the idea of generators in the context of cyclic groups to the notion of generating sets. For instance, 
suppose we wanted to find the smallest subgroup containing two elements or more. Then this subgroup must contain all finite 
products of these elements (for instance, a subgroup containing elements $a$ and $b$ must contain $a^2b^4a^{-3}$, $a^0b^3$, etc.). 

More precisely, let $\{S_i : i \in I\}$ be a collection of sets where $I$ may be any set of indices. Let $G$ be a group and
let $a_i \in G$ for $i \in I$. The smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $\{ a_i : i \in I \}$ is the
**subgroup generated by $\{a_i : i \in I\}$**. If this subgroup is all of $G$, then $\{ a_i : i \in I\}$
**generates** $G$ and the $a_i$ are **generators of $G$**. If there is a finite set $\{ a_i : i \in I\}$
that generates $G$, then $G$ is **finitely generated**.

# Generation

We now note that for any group $G$ and $a_i \in G$ for $i \in I$, there exists at least one subgroup of $G$
containing all the elements $a_i$ for $i \in I$, namely $G$ itself. The intersection of all subgroups of $G$
containing all $a_i$ for $i \in I$, which is also a group[^1], must then be the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing
all the $a_i$ for $i \in I$.

In fact, if $G$ is a group and $a_i \in G$ for $i \in I$, then the subgroup $H$ of $G$ generated by
$\{ a_i : i \in I \}$ has as elements precisely those elements of $G$ that are finite products of integral
powers of the $a_i$, where powers of a fixed $a_i$ may occur several times in the product.

<div class="proof">

Let $K$ denote the set of all finite products of integral powers of the $a_i$. Then $K \subseteq H$. 
We need only observe that $K$ is a subgroup and then, since $H$ is the smallest subgroup containing
$a_i$ for $i \in I$, we will be done. Observe that a product of elements in $K$ is again in $K$. Since
$(a_i)^0 = e$, we have $e \in K$. For every element $k$ in $K$, if we form from the product giving $k$ a
new product with the order of the $a_i$ reversed and the opposite sign on all exponents, we have
$k^{-1}$, which is thus in $K$. Thus $K$ is indeed a group.
