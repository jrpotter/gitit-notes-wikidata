![Complex Plane $\bbc$](/img/graphs/complex/complex-plane.png)

A **complex number** is an expression of the form $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and $i$ satisfies
the rule $(i)^2 = (i)(i) = -1$. We call the number $x$ the **real part** of $z$, denoted $x = \text{Re}\;z$, and $y$
the **imaginary part** of $z$ denoted $y = \text{Im}\;z$. In addition, we say the absolute value of $z$ is defined by
$\norm{z} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and that the complex conjugate is given by $\bar{z} = x - iy$. 

Complex numbers can be represented as vectors, in which the real and imaginary components represent a vector's direction.
This naturally introduces the notion of the **complex plane**, upon which complex numbers can be graphed. The $x$-axis
and $y$-axis are subsequently called the **real** and **imaginary axes** respectively. By use of the complex plane, we
can graphically interpret what it means to add and subtract vectors (via the Triangle Law or Parallelogram Law), and
can obtain visuals on less obvious operations such as multiplication.

# Polar Representation

Since we can represent complex numbers in a plane, and consequently assign a point $P(x, y)$ for every $z = x + iy$, then
we can introduce parameters in the form of polar coordinates. That is, we can assign
$$ x = r\cos{\theta} \;\text{ and }\; y = r\sin{\theta} $$
where $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\theta$ is the angle measured from the real axis to the line segment from the origin to $P$.
Therefore, since $r = \norm{z}$, the polar representation of $z$ is
$$ z = \norm{z}(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta). $$

## Multiplication/Division

<div class="block">

![Complex Multiplication](/img/graphs/complex/multiplication.png)

The multiplication and division of complex numbers between themselves
yield very elegant formulas. That is, if $z$ and $w$ are two complex numbers with polar representations
$$ z = \norm{z}(\cos{\theta} + i\sin{\theta}) \;\text{ and }\; w = \norm{w}(\cos{\phi} + i\sin{\phi}), $$
then $$ zw = \norm{zw}(\cos{(\theta + \phi)} + i\sin{(\theta + \phi)}) $$
and $$ \frac{z}{w} = \left(\frac{\norm{z}}{\norm{w}}\right)(\cos{(\theta - \phi)} + i\sin{(\theta - \phi)}). $$

</div>

<div class="proof">

First, by the [Addition Formulas](trigonometric_identities#addition-formulas),
$$\begin{align*}
  zw &= \norm{z}\norm{w}((\cos\theta\cos\phi - \sin\theta\sin\phi) + i(\cos\theta\sin\phi + \cos\phi\sin\theta)) \\
     &= \norm{zw}(\cos{(\theta + \phi)} + i\sin{(\theta + \phi)}).
\end{align*}$$
Next, by the [Subtraction Formulas](trigonometric_identities#subtraction-formulas),
$$\begin{align*}
  \frac{z}{w} &= \frac{\norm{z}(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)}{\norm{w}(\cos\phi + i\sin\phi)}              \\
              &= \left(\frac{\norm{z}}{\norm{w}}\right)(\cos\theta\cos\phi + \sin\theta\sin\phi 
                                                    + i(\cos\phi\sin\theta - \cos\theta\sin\phi))       \\
              &= \left(\frac{\norm{z}}{\norm{w}}\right)(\cos{(\theta - \phi)} + i\sin{(\theta - \phi)}).
\end{align*}$$

## De Moivre's Theorem

In light of the [multiplication and division](#multiplicationdivision) of complex numbers, De Moivere's Theorem becomes almost
obvious: $$ (cos\theta + i\sin\theta)^n = \cos{(n\theta)} + i\sin{(n\theta)}. $$

<div class="proof">

We proceed via inductions.

- *Base Case:*  
  Suppose $n = 1$. In this situation, the formula obviously holds true.

- *Induction Hypothesis:*  
  We assume $(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)^m = \cos{(m\theta)} + i\sin{(m\theta)}$.

- *Induction Step:*  
  Consider the following:
  $$\begin{align*}
    (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)^{m+1} &= (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)^m(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \\
                                     &= (\cos{(m\theta)} + i\sin{(m\theta)})(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \\
                                     &= \cos{((m+1)\theta)} + i\sin{((m+1)\theta)},
  \end{align*}$$
  where the last step holds by the property of multiplication and the induction hypothesis.

## Arguments

For the sake of conciseness, we define the **argument** of the nonzero complex number $z$ to be any angle $\theta$ for
which $$ z = \norm{z}(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta), $$ denoted $\theta = \text{arg}\;z$. A concrete choice of $\text{arg}\;z$
is made by defining **$\textbf{Arg}\;z$** to be the number $\theta_0$ in the interval $[-\pi, \pi)$ such that
$$ z = \norm{z}(\cos\theta_0 + i\sin\theta_0). $$

# Geometry

<div class="block">

![Closed Half-Plane](/img/graphs/complex/half-plane.png)

We can view much of complex in a geometrical setting by considering equations regarding complex variables as expressions
of subsets of the complex plane (much like in a real numbers setting). Namely, we call the **boundary** to be the set of
all boundary points of a set $S$, where a point $p$ is a **boundary point** of $S$ if every open disc centered at $p$
contains both points of $S$ and points not in $S$. A set is **open** is all points in the set has an open disc centered
at the point lying entirely in $D$. A set is **closed** if it contains its boundary.

Furthermore, a set $D$ is considered to contain the point at infinity  in its interior if there is a large number $M$ such 
that $D$ contains all the points $z$ with $\abs{z} > M$. One "reaches" the point at infinity, denoted $\infty$, by letting 
$\abs{z}$ increase without bound, with no restriction on $\text{arg}\;z$.

Lastly, we note a set $D$ is open if and only if it contains no point of its boundary and a set $C$ is closed if and only 
if its complement $D = \{z : z \neq C\}$ is open.

</div>

<div class="proof">

- Open
:    $\forward$ Suppose $D$ is an open set. Let $p$ be a boundary point of $D$. If it happens that $p$ is in $D$, then there 
     is an open disc centered at $p$ that lies within $D$. Thus, $p$ is not in the boundary of $D$ which is a contradiction.
     Therefore $p$ is not in the boundary of $D$.<br />  
     $\backward$ Suppose $D$ is a set that contains none of its boundary points. If $z_0 \in D$, then $z_0$ cannot be a 
     boundary point of $D$. Therefore there exists some disc centered at $z_0$ that is either a subset of $D$ or a subset of 
     the complement of $D$. The latter is impossible since $z_0$ itself is in $D$. Therefore the disc lies in $D$ and,
     consequently, each point of $D$ is an interior point meaning $D$ is open.

- Closed
:    Note that the boundary of a set coincides with the boundary of the complement of the set. The rest follows.

## Roots

<div class="block">

![Fifth Roots of Unity](/img/diagrams/abstract/fifth-roots-of-unity.png)

Suppose $w$ is a nonzero complex number and $n$ is a positive integer. Then a complex number $z$ satisfying the equation $z^n = w$
is called an **$\spscript{n}{th}$ root of $w$**. We note then that the solutions to this equation are
$$ z = \norm{w}^{\frac{1}{n}}(\cos{\theta_k} + i\sin{\theta_k}) $$
where $$ \theta_k = \frac{\psi}{n} + k\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right), \quad k = 0, 1, \ldots, n - 1. $$

</div>

<div class="proof">

Let $w = \norm{w}(\cos\psi + i\sin\psi)$ be the polar representation of $w$ where $\psi \in [-\pi, \pi)$. If
$z = \norm{z}(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$, then by [De Moivre's Theorem](#de-moivres-theorem) we see that
$$ \norm{z}^n = \norm{w}, \quad \cos{(n\theta)} = \cos\psi, \quad \sin{(n\theta)} = \sin\psi. $$
Now consider $$ \theta_k = \frac{\psi}{n} + k\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right), \quad k = 0, 1, \ldots, n - 1, $$
and note that $n\theta_k = \psi + 2\pi k = \psi$ as desired. Thus $n$ distinct solutions are
$$ z_k = \norm{w}^{\frac{1}{n}}(\cos\theta_k + i\sin\theta_k), \quad k = 0, 1, \ldots, n - 1. $$
Moreover these are the only possible roots since for
$$ \cos{n\theta} = \cos\psi \;\text{ and }\; \sin{n\theta} = \sin\psi, $$
we must have $n\theta = \psi + 2\pi j$ for some integer $j$, and any values besides the $k$ listed previously 
yields a number already inspected.

## Straight Lines

Suppose $a = A + iB$ is a nonzero complex number and $b$ is any complex number. Then
$$ 0 = \text{Re}(az + b) $$
is the straight line $Ax - By + \text{Re}(b) = 0$. Note that $i$ does not appear in the equation; instead, values of
$y$ correspond to the imaginary axis. As an aside, we can also represent straight lines parametrically. If $z_1$ and
$z_2$ are two distinct complex numbers, $tz_1 + (1-t)z_2$ for values $0 \leq t \leq 1$ describes the line segment
between the two.[^1]

<div class="proof">

Note the following:
$$\begin{align*}
  0 &= \text{Re}(az + b)                   \\
    &= \text{Re}[(A + iB)(x + iy) + b]     \\
    &= \text{Re}[Ax - By + b + i(Ay + Bx)] \\
    &= Ax - By + Re(b).
\end{align*}$$

## Circles

A circle is the set of all points equidistant from a given point, the center. If $z_0$ is the center and $r$ is the radius,
then the circle of radius $r$ and center $z_0$ is described by equation $$ \norm{z - z_0} = r. $$ Note that the following,
though not used as frequently, also represents a circle: $$ \norm{z - p} = \rho\norm{z - q} $$ where $p, q$ are complex numbers
and $\rho$ is a positive real number not equal to $1$.
