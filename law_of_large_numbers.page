First we establish the **weak law of large numbers**, which states that a sample average converges in probability towards
the expected value. There also exists the **strong law of large numbers** which states that the the sample average almost 
surely converges towards the expected value. 

The two statements are very similar and as such, it is useful to distinguish between what we mean by convergence in probability
and almost surely converging. In the weak law, convergence in probability states that the chances of the difference between the
sample average and $\mu$ being greater than $\epsilon$ gets smaller and smaller, but it is still possible (just very unlikely).

In the strong law, almost surely converging states that the number of times this difference is greater than some fixed $\epsilon$
is finite. That is, at some $N \in \bbn$, the difference between the sample mean $(\inflatec[+]{X}{n}) / n$ and the actual mean
$\mu$ will always be smaller than some $\epsilon$ for all $n \geq N$.

# Weak Law of Large Numbers

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, each having finite mean 
$E[X_i] = \mu$. Then, for any $\epsilon > 0$,
$$ \bbps{\abs{\frac{\inflatec[+]{X}{n}}{n} - \mu} \geq \epsilon} \rightarrow 0 \text{ as } n \rightarrow \infty. $$

<div class="proof">

Assume that the random variables have a finite variance $\sigma^2$. Now, by hypothesis,
$$ 
  E\left[\frac{\inflatec[+]{X}{n}}{n}\right] = \mu \text{ and } 
  \text{Var}\left(\frac{\inflatec[+]{X}{n}}{n}\right) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}.
$$
Thus, [Chebyshev's Inequality](chebyshevs_inequality) states that 
$$ \bbps{\abs{\frac{\inflatec[+]{X}{n}}{n} - \mu} \geq \epsilon} \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{n\epsilon^2}. $$
Taking the limit of $n$ as it approaches $\infty$ proves our result.

# Strong Law of Large Numbers

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, each having a finite mean 
$\mu = E[X_i]$. Then, with probability $1$, 
$$ \frac{\inflatec[+]{X}{n}}{n} \rightarrow \mu \;\text{ as }\; n \rightarrow \infty. $$
