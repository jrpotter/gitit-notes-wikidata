For a discrete random variable $X$, we define the **probability mass function** $p(a)$ of $X$ by
$$ p(a) = \bbp[X=a]. $$ The probability mass function $p(a)$ is positive for at most a countable
number of values of $a$. That is, if $X$ must assume one of the values $x_1, x_2, \ldots$, then
$$\begin{align*}
  p(x_i) &\geq 0\text{ for }i = 1, 2, \ldots \\
  p(x) &= 0\text{ for all other values of }x
\end{align*}$$

# Cumulative Distribution Function

For a random variable $X$, the function $F$ defined by $$ F(x)=\bbps{X \leq x}, -\infty < x < \infty $$
is called the **cumulative distributive function**, or, more simply, the **distribution function**, of $X$.
Thus, the distribution function specifies, for all real values $x$, the probability that the random
variable is less than or equal to $x$.

# Joint Probability Mass Function

In the case where $X$ and $Y$ are both discrete, we define the **joint probability mass function** of $X$ and $Y$ by
$$ p(x, y) = \bbps{X = x, Y = y}. $$
The probability mass function of $X$ is then found by
$$ p_X(x) = \bbps{X = x} = \sum_{y: p(x, y)> 0} p(x, y), $$
with a similar formula holding for $Y$.
