# Summary

Let $H$ be a subgroup of a finite group $\lrangle{G, *}$. Then the order of $H$ is a divisor of the order of $G$. Note that
the converse is not necessarily true; if some subset $H$ of $G$ is a divisor of the order of $G$, it does not
necessarily mean $\lrangle{H, *}$ is a subgroup.

<div class="proof">

To begin with, we show that all cosets are of the same size. This is shown by a one-to-one map of $H$ onto a left
coset $gH$ of $H$ for a fixed element $g$ of $G$. Define $\phi: H \rightarrow gH$ by $\phi(h) = gh$ for each $h \in H$.
We note $\phi$ is one-to-one since if $\phi(h_1) = \phi(h_2)$ for $h_1$ and $h_2$, then $gh_1 = gh_2$ and by the
cancellation laws $h_1 = h_2$. It must also be onto $gH$ since, by definition, $gH$ is $\{gh : h \in H\}$. The
same applies for right cosets.

Now, let $n$ be the order of $G$, and let $H$ have order $m$. Then every coset of $H$ also has $m$ elements. If we
let $r$ be the number of cells in the partition of $G$ into left cosets of $H$, then $n = rm$, so $m$ is indeed a
divisor of $n$.

# Prime Order

A direct consequence of the Theorem of Lagrange states that a group of prime order must be cyclic.

<div class="proof">

Let $G$ be of prime order $p$, and let $a$ be an element of $G$ different from the identity. Then the cyclic
subgroup $\lrangle{a}$ of $G$ generated by $a$ has at least two elements, $a$ and $e$. But since all subgroups
must have an order that divides $G$ by the Theorem of Lagrange, $\lrangle{a}$ must have order $m \geq 2$ that
divides $p$. Therefore $\left|\lrangle{a}\right} = p$ so $G$ is cyclic.
