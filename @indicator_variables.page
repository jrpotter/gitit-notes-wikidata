# Generating Subsets

Consider a method that generates each subset of size $\binom{n}{k}$ with equal probability.
One memory-efficient process is to generate a series of random indicator variables, where
a value of $1$ indicates that a uniform $(0, 1)$ random variable is less than the probability
that a given value would be chosen in the subset given the remaining spaces left.

~~~ { .python }
import random

def subset(n, k):
    total = 0
    group = []
    for i in range(n):
        if random.random() < (k - total) / (n - i):
            total += 1
            group.append(i)
    return group
~~~
This method results in all subsets being equally likely to be generated.
