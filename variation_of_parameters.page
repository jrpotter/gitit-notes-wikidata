# Summary

If the functions $p$, $q$, and $g$ are continuous on an open interval $I$, and if the functions $y_1$ and $y2$ are a
fundamental set of solutions of the homogeneous equation corresponding to the nonhomogeneous equation
$$ y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = g(t), $$ then a particular solution of this nonhomogeneous equation is
$$ 
  Y(t) = -y_1(t)\int_{t_0}^t \frac{y_2(t)g(t)}{W(y_1, y_2)(s)}\;ds 
       + y_2(t) \int_{t_0}^t \frac{y_1(s)g(s)}{W(y_1, y_2)(s)}\;ds, 
$$ 
where $t_0$ is any conveniently chosen point in $I$. The general solution is then
$$ y = c_2y_2(t) + c_2y_2(t) + Y(t). $$

<div class="proof">

Consider $$ y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = g(t), $$ where $p$, $q$, and $g$ are given continuous functions. As a starting point,
we assume that we know the general solution $$ y_c(t) = c_1y_1(t) + c_2y_2(t) $$ of the corresponding homogeneous equation.
Instead of considering $c_1$ and $c_2$ though, we replace them with functions $u_1(t)$ and $u_2(t)$ in the hopes of finding
a solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. For convenience sake, set $$ u_1'(t)y_1(t) + u_2'(t)y_2(t) = 0. \quad (1) $$
Therefore
$$\begin{align*}
  y &= u_1(t)y_1(t) + u_2(t)y_2(t)                                         \\
  y' &= u_1'(t)y_1(t) + u_1(t)y_1'(t) + u_2'(t)y_2(t) + u_2(t)y_2'(t)      \\
     &= u_1(t)y_1'(t) + u_2(t)y_2'(t)                                      \\
  y'' &= u_1'(t)y_1'(t) + u_1(t)y_1''(t) + u_2'(t)y_2'(t) + u_2(t)y_2''(t).
\end{align*}$$

Substituting these values into our nonhomogeneous equation and rearranging terms, we get
$$
  u_1(t)[y_1''(t) + p(t)y_1'(t) + q(t)y_1(t)] 
  + u_2(t)[y_2''(t) + p(t)y_2'(t) + q(t)y_2(t)]
  + u_1'(t)y_1'(t) + u_2'(t)y_2'(t) = g(t).
$$
But since $y_1$ and $y_2$ are zero, values in the square brackets above evaluate to $0$ and we're left with
$$ u_1'(t)y_1'(t) + u_2'(t)y_2'(t) = g(t). \quad (2) $$

Note that $(1)$ and $(2)$ create a linear system of equations as follows:
$$
  \begin{bmatrix} y_1(t) & y_2(t) \\ y_1'(t) & y_2'(t) \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} u_1'(t) \\ u_2'(t) \end{bmatrix} = 
  \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ g(t) \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Therefore, noting the determinant of the left square matrix is the [Wronskian](wronskian), and by use of 
[Cramer's Rule](cramers_rule), we get that
$$ u_1'(t) = -\frac{y_2(t)g(t)}{W(y_1, y_2)(t)}, \quad u_2'(t) = \frac{y_1(t)g(t)}{W(y_1, y_2)(t)}. $$
Note that division by the Wronskian is indeed permissible since $y_1$ and $y_2$ are a 
[fundamental set of solutions](wronskian#fundamental-set-of-solutions), implying that the Wronskian is nonzero. Thus, by 
integrating these values and placing them back in modified nonhomogeneous equation $y$, we get our result. The fact that the 
general solution is as described follows from the theory of [nonhomogeneous equations](nonhomogeneous_equations).
