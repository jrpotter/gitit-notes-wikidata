![Finite Subcovers](/img/diagrams/analysis/compact-spaces.png)

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $E \subset X$. An **open cover** of $E$ is a collection of $\{G_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$,
where each $G_\alpha \subset X$ is open and $E \subset \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} G_\alpha$. We say $E$ is **compact** if
every open cover of $E$ has a finite subcover; that is, whenever $E \subset \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} G_\alpha$ where
$G_\alpha$ is open, then there exists $\inflate{\alpha}{n}$ such that $E \subset (G_{\alpha_1} \cup \cdots \cup G_{\alpha_n})$.

Intuitively speaking, we recognize that finite sets are very easy to work with. After all, they are very small, have no limit
points, and the notion of infinity is often difficult to wrestle. But, in lieu of this, we can look at compact sets as being
the next best thing. For instance, all finite sets are bounded, closed, and in $\bbr$, they contain their supremum and infimum. These all hold with compact sets as well.

# Boundedness

All compact sets are bounded.

<div class="proof">

Let $K$ be a compact set. Consider the collection of neighborhoods of radius $1$ around each point of set $K$. That is, for all points $p \in K$, we have a neighborhood $N_1(p)$ around $p$. Now the set $\{ N_1(p) \}_{p \in K}$ is an open cover of $K$. By compactness of $K$, there exists a finite subcover $\{ N_1(p_i) \}_{i=1}^n$ of $K$. Now let
$$ R = \mathop{\text{max}}_{1 \leq i \leq n} \{ d(p_1, p_i) \}, $$
which must exist because there is a finite number of pairwise distances. Then $N_{R + 2}(p_1)$
contains all of $K$, so $K$ is bounded.

# Closed

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $K \subset X$ be compact. Then $K$ is closed in $X$.
Furthermore, suppose $E \subset K$ is a closed set. Then $E$ must be compact.

<div class="proof">

Choose $p \in K^C$. For each $q \in K$, choose 
$$ V_q = N_{\frac{1}{4}d(p, q)}(p) \text{ and } W_q = N_{\frac{1}{4}d(p, q)}(q), $$ which
are disjoint. So $\{W_q\}_{q \in K}$ is an open cover of $K$. Since $K$ is compact, we can reduce this set to a 
finite subcover $\{W_{q_1}, \ldots, W_{q_N}\}$. Now, note that $$ V_q \cap W_q = \emptyset. $$ 
Furthermore, the set of corresponding neighborhoods in $K^C$ is
$\{ V_{q_1}, \ldots, V_{q_n} \}$, the intersection of which is simply the neighborhood 
corresponding to the closest $q \in K$, according to our metric. Thus
$$ \bigcap \{ V_{q_1}, \ldots, V_{q_n} \} $$ is open[^1], contains $p$, and is disjoint from 
$\bigcup_{j=1}^N W_{q_j}$. Since this implies $K^C$ is open, we see that $K$ must be closed.

*****

Start with an open cover of $E$. That is, let $\{V_{\alpha}\}$ be an open cover of $E$. Now, $\{V_\alpha\} \cup E^C$
must be an open cover of $K$. Thus there exists a finite collection of sets, $$ V_{\alpha_1}, \ldots, V_{\alpha_n}, E^C $$
that covers $K$, since $K$ is compact. Thus, $V_{\alpha_1}, \ldots, V_{\alpha_n}$ covers $E$.

# Limit Points

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $K \subset X$ be compact. Also, let $E \subset K$ be infinite. Then $E$ has a 
[limit point](metric_spaces#neighborhoods) in $K$.

<div class="proof">

Suppose $E$ has no limit point in $K$. Then for every $q \in K$, there exists a neighborhood $V_q$ containing $q$ such that
$$ \left(V_q \backslash \{q\}\right) \cap E = \emptyset. $$ For each $q \in E$, we then have $V_q \cap E = \{q\}$.
Now $\{V_q\}_{q \in K}$ is an open cover of $E$, but there cannot be a finite subcover of $E$ since $E$ is infinite
and each neighborhood contains a single point. Therefore $\{V_q\}_{q \in K}$ is an open cover with no finite subcover,
contradicting $K$'s compactness.

# Finite Intersection Property

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $\{K_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ be a collection of compact sets, inside $X$. Suppose
every finite subcollection has a nonempty intersection. Then $$ \bigcap_{\alpha \in A} K_\alpha \neq \emptyset. $$
It then directly follows that if we have a decreasing sequence of compact sets, the intersection of these sets is nonempty.
That is, if $\{K_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of nonempty compact sets, with $K_{n+1} \subset K_n$ for all $n$, 
then $$ \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} K_n \neq \emptyset. $$

<div class="proof">

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $\cap_{\alpha \in A} K_{\alpha} = \emptyset$. Fix 
$K_{\alpha_0} \in \{K_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$. Then 
$$ K_{\alpha_0} \cap \left(\bigcap_{\alpha \in A \backslash \{\alpha_0\}} K_\alpha \right) = \emptyset. $$
Therefore 
$$ 
  K_{\alpha_0} \subset \left(\bigcap_{A \backslash \{\alpha_0\}} K_\alpha\right)^C 
               = \bigcup_{A \backslash \{\alpha_0\}} K_{\alpha}^C. 
$$
Since each $K_\alpha$ is closed, the complements must be open meaning we have an open cover of $K_{\alpha_0}$.
Since $K_{\alpha_0}$ is compact, there must exist a finite subcover such that
$$ K_{\alpha_0} \subset K_{\alpha_1}^C \cup \cdots \cup K_{\alpha_n}^C = \left(\bigcap_{j=1}^n K_{\alpha_j}\right)^C. $$
Therefore $$ K_{\alpha_0} \cap \left(\bigcap_{j=1}^n K_{\alpha_j}\right) = \emptyset, $$ which is a finite subcollection
with an empty intersection, a contradiction.
