![Different One-Sided Limits](/img/graphs/calculus/one-sided-limits.png)

Limits can also approach from just one side. For instance, given a bounded interval $[a, b]$, a limit can approach $b$ from
the left side and $a$ from the right side. The left-handed limit and right-handed limits respectively are
$$ \xlimit[-]{x}{a}\;f(x) = L \text{ and } \xlimit[+]{x}{a} f(x) = L $$
if for every number $\epsilon > 0$ there is a number $\delta > 0$ such that if $a - \delta < x < a$ (or $a < x < a + \delta$)
then $\left|\;f(x)-L\right| < \epsilon$. We also note that if the limit of some value is the same from the left and right, 
then the limit exists at the given point. That is,
$$ \xlimit{x}{a}\;f(x) = L \text{ if and only if } \xlimit[-]{x}{a}\;f(x) = L \text{ and } \xlimit[+]{x}{a}\;f(x) = L. $$
