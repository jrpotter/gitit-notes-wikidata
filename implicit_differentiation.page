# Summary

**Implicit Differentiation** involves differentiating both sides of an equation with respect to $x$ and solving
the resulting equation in terms of $y'$. Note $y$ is a function of $x$ so the [Chain Rule](chain_rule)
must be applied. One can also employ **logarithmic differentiation** by taking the natural log of both sides 
of an equation $y = f(x)$ and using the Laws of Logarithms to simplify. Afterwords, implicit differentiation is 
employed, and one can solve for $y'$.

# Implicit Function Theorem

Implicit differentiation can be generalized to functions of more than one variable by differentiating both sides of an
equation $F(x, y) = 0$ with respect to $x$. That is, by use of the chain rule in the case of a [single
independent](chain_rule#single-independent) variable, we have

$$ \pleibniz[F]{x}\leibniz[x]{x} + \pleibniz[F]{y}\leibniz[y]{x} = 0. $$

But $dx/dx = 1$, so if $\partial F/\partial y \neq 0$, then 

$$ \leibniz[y]{x} = -\frac{\pleibniz[F]{x}}{\pleibniz[F]{y}} = -\frac{F_x}{F_y}. $$

Furthermore
$$ 
  \pleibniz[z]{x} = -\frac{\pleibniz[F]{x}}{\pleibniz[F]{z}} = \frac{F_x}{F_z} \;\text{ and }\;
  \pleibniz[z]{y} = -\frac{\pleibniz[F]{y}}{\pleibniz[F]{z}} = \frac{F_y}{F_z}. 
$$
