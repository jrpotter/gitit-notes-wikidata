In the simplest sense of the theorem, we state that if $n + 1$ objects are distributed into $n$ boxes, then at least
one box contains two or more of the objects. Alternatively, we can state the principle in its strong form:
Let $\inflate{q}{n}$ be positive integers. If $$ \inflatec[+]{q}{n} - n + 1 $$ objects are distributed into $n$ 
boxes, then either the first box contains at least $q_1$ objects, or the second box contains at least $q_2$
objects, $\ldots$, or the $\spscript{n}{th}$ box contains at least $q_n$ objects.

</div>

<div class="proof">

To prove the simple statement, we note that if each of the $n$ objects contains at most one of the objects, then the 
total number of objects is at most $1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 \;(n\; 1\text{s}) = n$. Since we distribute $n + 1$ objects, then this 
yields a contradiction. Thus some box contains at least two of the objects.

We now prove the strong statement. Suppose that we distribute $\inflatec[+]{q}{n} - n + 1$ objects among $n$ boxes.
If for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$ the $\spscript{i}{th}$ box contains fewer than $q_i$ objects, then the total number
of objects in all boxes does not exceed $$ (q_1 - 1) + (q_2 - 1) + \cdots + (q_n - 1) = \inflatec[+]{q}{n} - n. $$
Since this number is one less than the number of objects distributed, we conclude that for some $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$
the $\spscript{i}{th}$ box contains at least $q_i$ objects.
