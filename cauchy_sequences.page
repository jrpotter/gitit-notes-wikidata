![Cauchy Sequence](/img/diagrams/analysis/cauchy-sequence.png)

A sequence $(a_n)$ is called a **Cauchy Sequence** if, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N \in \bbn$
such that whenever $m, n \geq N$ it follows that $\abs{a_n - a_m} < \epsilon$. Generalizing to an arbitrary metric
space $(X, d)$, we say a sequence $(a_n)$ is Cauchy if for every positive real number $\epsilon > 0$, there is a
positive integer $N$ such that for all positive integers $m, n \geq N$, we have $d(a_m, a_n) < \epsilon$.

This definition turns out to be very useful as we now can prove convergence, via the [Cauchy Criterion](#cauchy-criterion), 
without knowing the limit of a given function.

# Boundedness

Cauchy sequences are bounded.

<div class="proof">

Suppose we have a Cauchy sequence $(x_n)$. Then, given $\epsilon = 1$, there exists an $N$ such that
$d(x_m, x_n) < 1$ for all $m, n \geq N$. Thus, we must have $d(x_n, x_N) < 1$ for all $n \geq N$. It follows that 
$$ M = \text{max}\{d(x_1, x_N), \;d(x_2, x_N), \;\ldots, \;d(x_{N-1}, x_N), \;1\} $$
is a bound for the sequence $(x_n)$.

# Cauchy Criterion

A sequence converges if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence.

<div class="proof">

$\forward$ Suppose a sequence $(x_n)$ converges to a value $x$. Then there exists an $N \in \bbn$ such that for all
$n \geq N$, we have $d(x_n, x) < \epsilon/2$. Similarly, for any $m \geq N$, we also have $d(x_m, x) < \epsilon/2$.
Now, to prove a sequence is Cauchy, we must show that $d(x_m, x_n) < \epsilon$. But, by the 
[Triangle Inequality](triangle_inequality), we have:
$$\begin{align*}
  d(x_m, x_n) &\leq d(x_m, x) + d(x, x_n)                \\
              &< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\
              &= \epsilon.
\end{align*}$$

$\backward$ Suppose we have a Cauchy sequence $(x_n)$, which must be [bounded](#boundedness). Then, by the
[Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem](bolzano_weierstrass_theorem), we can produce a convergent subseqence $(x_{n_k})$.
Set $x = \lim x_{n_k}$. We want to show that the original sequence $(x_n)$ converges to this same limit.

Let $\epsilon > 0$. Because $(x_n)$ is Cauchy, there exists $N$ such that
$$ \abs{x_n - x_m} < \frac{\epsilon}{2} $$ whenever $m, n > N$. Since we know that $(x_{n_k}) \rightarrow x$,
we can choose a term in this subsequence, call it $x_{n_K}$, with $n_K \geq N$ and
$$ \abs{x_{n_K} - x} < \frac{\epsilon}{2}. $$ It then follows that
$$\begin{align*}
  \abs{x_n - x} &= \abs{x_n - x_{n_K} + x_{n_K} - x}                  \\
                &\leq \abs{x_n - x_{n_K}} + \abs{x_{n_K} - x}         \\
                &< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon.
\end{align*}$$
