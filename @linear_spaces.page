# Differentiation

Consider the transformation $D(f) = f'$ from $\bbc^{\infty}$ to $\bbc^{\infty}$. It follows from the 
[rules of differentiation](rules_of_differentiation) that $D$ is a linear transformation since
$$\begin{align*}
  D(f+g) &= (f+g)'      \\
         &= f' + g'     \\
         &= D(f) + D(g)
\end{align*}$$
and
$$\begin{align*}
  D(kf) &= (kf)' \\
        &= kf'   \\
        &= kD(f)
\end{align*}$$ 

We identify the kernel of $D$ to be the set of functions such that the derivative is $0$. The notion of 
general antiderivatives[^1] show us that $\text{ker}(D)$ is the set of constant functions. The image consists of 
all smooth functions $g$ such that $g = D(f) = f'$ for some function $f$ in $\bbc^{\infty}$. The 
[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](fundamental_theorem_of_calculus) implies that all continuous (and therefore smooth) 
functions have an antiderivative so $\text{im}(D) = \bbc^{\infty}$.
