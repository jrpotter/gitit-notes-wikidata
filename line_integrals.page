![Over Vector Field](/img/diagrams/calculus/line-integral-vector-field.png)

We define the **line integral** over continuous vector fields, which serve as the basis of vector calculus, as the amount of 
work (i.e. the physics quantity) along the curve. More generally, the line integral is a summation of the dot product between
the force applied on a particular point and the tangential component of the curve at said point. More specifically,
let $\pmb{F}$ be a continuous vector field defined on a smooth curve $C$ given by a vector function 
$\pmb{r}(t), a \leq t \leq b$. Then the line integral of $\pmb{F}$ along $C$ is
$$ \int_C \pmb{F} \cdot d\pmb{r} = \int_a^b \pmb{F}(\pmb{r}(t)) \cdot \pmb{r}'(t)\;dt = \int_C \pmb{F} \cdot \pmb{T}\;ds. $$

We note that unlike path integrals with respect to arc length, reversing the direction of the line integral over a curve $C$ 
yields a negative value since the unit tangent vector $\pmb{T}$ is replaced by its negative when $C$ is replaced by $-C$.

<div class="proof">

As a reminder, we note that work can be evaluated by $W = \pmb{F} \cdot \pmb{D}$, where $\pmb{D} = \overrightarrow{PQ}$ is
the displacement vector and $\pmb{F}$ is a constant force moving an object from point $P$ to point $Q$. We prove the case
for force fields of $\bbr^3$, with the understanding that the proof in $\bbr^2$ is analogous.

Now suppose that $\pmb{F} = P\pmb{i} + Q\pmb{j} + R\pmb{k}$ is a continuous force field on $\bbr^3$. Given some curve $C$,
we can divide $C$ into subarcs $P_{i-1}P_i$ with lengths $\Delta{s_i}$ by dividing the parameter interval $[a, b]$ into
subintervals of equal width. Choose a point $P_i^*(x_i^*, y_i^*, z_i^*)$ on the $\spscript{i}{th}$ subarc corresponding
to the parameter value $t_i^*$. If $\Delta{s_i}$ is small, then as the particle moves from $P_{i-1}$ to $P_i$ along the
curve, it proceeds approximately in the direction of $\pmb{T}(t_i^*)$, the unit tangent vector at $P_i^*$. Thus the work
done by the force $\pmb{F}$ in moving the particle from $P_{i-1}$ to $P_i$ is approximately
$$ 
  \pmb{F}(x_i^*, y_i^*, z_i^*) \cdot \left[ \Delta{s_i}\pmb{T}(t_i^*) \right] = 
  \left[\pmb{F}(x_i^*, y_i^*, z_i^*)\cdot\pmb{T}(t_i^*)\right]\Delta{s_i}
$$
and the total work done in moving the particle along $C$ is approximately
$$ \sum_{i=1}^n \left[\pmb{F}(x_i^*, y_i^*, _i^*) \cdot \pmb{T}(x_i^*, y_i^*, z_i^*)\right]\Delta{s_i} $$
where $\pmb{T}(x, y, z)$ is the unit tangent vector at the point $(x, y, z)$ on $C$. Intuitively, we see that these approximations
ought to become better as $n$ becomes larger. Therefore we define the work $W$ done by the force field $\pmb{F}$ as the
limit of the Riemann sums, namely,
$$ W = \int_C \pmb{F}(x, y, z) \cdot \pmb{T}(x, y, z)\;ds = \int_C \pmb{F} \cdot \pmb{T}\;ds. $$
Lastly, if the curve $C$ is given by vector equation $\pmb{r}(t) = x(t)\pmb{i} + y(t)\pmb{j} + z(t)\pmb{k},\;\;$ then
$\pmb{T}(t) = \pmb{r}'(t)/\left|\pmb{r}'(t)\right|,\;\;$ so
$$ 
  W = \int_C \left[ \pmb{F}(\pmb{r}(t)) \cdot \frac{\pmb{r}'(t)}{\left|\pmb{r}'(t)\right|}\right]\left|\pmb{r}'(t)\right|\;dt
    = \int_a^b \pmb{F}(\pmb{r}(t)) \cdot \pmb{r}'(t)\;dt. \;

# Path Integral Variants

Path integrals also go by the name of line integrals, and, as such, we'd expect there to be some relation between the two.
In fact, the **line integrals of $\;f$ along $C$ with respect to $x$ and $y$** (as opposed to with arc length) do closely
relate to line integrals over vector spaces. They are defined respectively as:
$$\begin{gather*}
  \int_C \;f(x, y)\;dx = \int_a^b \;f(x(t), y(t))x'(t)\;dt \\
  \int_C \;f(x, y)\;dy = \int_a^b \;f(x(t), y(t))y'(t)\;dt,
\end{gather*}$$
extending to higher dimensions in the obvious way. It frequently happens that line integrals with respect to $x$ and $y$
occur together, leading to the abbreviation
$$ \int_C P(x, y)\;dx + \int_C Q(x, y)\;dy = \int_C P(x, y)\;dx + Q(x, y)\;dy. $$
This leads to the following relation:
$$ \int_C \pmb{F} \cdot d\pmb{r} = \int_C P(x, y)\;dx + Q(x, y)\;dy. $$

<div class="proof">

First, note the definitions are derived from the [Chain Rule](chain_rule). That is, we see that 
$$ dx = x'(t)dt \;\text{ and }\; dy = y'(t)dt. $$ Next, notice that

$$\begin{align*} 
  \int_C \pmb{F} \cdot d\pmb{r} 
    &=  \int_a^b \pmb{F}(\pmb{r}(t)) \cdot \pmb{r}'(t)\;dt                    \\
    &= \int_a^b (P\pmb{i} + Q\pmb{j}) \cdot (x'(t)\pmb{i} + y'(t)\pmb{j})\;dt \\
    &= \int_a^b \left[P(x(t), y(t)) x'(t) + Q(x(t), y(t))\right]\;dt
\end{align*}$$
which is equivalent to the abbreviation established above.

# Complex Variables

In a similar manner to the [path integral variants](#path-integral-variants), we define the line integral of a continuous function
$u$ along the range of a smooth curve $\gamma$ by
$$ \int_\gamma u(z)\;dz = \int_a^b u(\gamma(t))\gamma'(t)\;dt. $$

<section class="secondary">

## Upper Bound

Suppose $\gamma$ is a smooth curve and $u$ is a continuous function on the range of $\gamma$. Then
$$ 
  \abs{\int_{\gamma} u(z)\;dz} \leq \left(\mathop{\text{max}}_{z \;\in\; \gamma} \abs{u(z)} \right) 
                                    \text{length}(\gamma) 
$$
where $$ \text{length}(\gamma) = \int_a^b \abs{\gamma'(t)}\;dt. $$

<div class="proof">

Let $g$ be a complex-valued continuous function on $[a, b]$. We need to show that
$$ \abs{\int_a^b g(t)\;dt} \leq \int_a^b \abs{g(t)}\;dt. $$
This inequality is obviously true if $\int_a^b g(t)\;dt = 0$, we we assume that $\int_a^b g(t)\;dt \neq 0$. Let 
$$ \theta = \text{Arg}\left(\int_a^b g(t)\;dt\right) $$ and define $h(t) = e^{-i\theta}g(t)$ for $a \leq t \leq b$.
Therefore
$$ 0 < \abs{\int_a^b g(t)\;dt} = e^{-i\theta}\int_a^b g(t)\;dt = \int_a^b e^{-i\theta}g(t)\;dt = \int_a^b h(t)\;dt, $$
where the first equality follows from the fact that for some complex number $z$, 
$$ z = \abs{z}e^{i\theta} \Rightarrow ze^{-i\theta} = \abs{z}. $$
Thus,
$$
  \abs{\int_a^b g(t)\;dt} = \text{Re} \int_a^b h(t)\;dt
                          = \int_a^b (\text{Re}\;h(t))\;dt
                          \leq \int_a^b \abs{h(t)}\;dt
                          = \int_a^b \abs{g(t)}\;dt.
$$
This then tells us that
$$\begin{align*}
  \abs{\int_\gamma u(z)\;dz} &= \abs{\int_a^b u(\gamma(t))\gamma'(t)\;dt}        \\
                             &= \int_a^b \abs{u(\gamma(t))}\abs{\gamma'(t)}\;dt.
\end{align*}$$
Because of the vector interpretation of complex numbers, we get that 
$$ \text{length}(\gamma) = \int_a^b \abs{\gamma'(t)}\;dt $$
and our result follows immediately.
