# Gauss's Law

For any *closed* surface enclosing total charge $Q_{\text{in}}$, the net electric flux through the surface is
$$ \phi_e = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{in}}}{\epsilon_0}. $$
Note that Gauss's Law tells us that charges create electric fields in just such a way that the net flux of the
field is the same through *any* surface surrounding the charges, no matter what its size and shape may be.
Also, a Gaussian surface is not a physical surface, and it need not coincide with the boundary of any
physical object. All that is necessary is that we can guess the *shape* of the field and consequently devise
a closed surface around the charge.
