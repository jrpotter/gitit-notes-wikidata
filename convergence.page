The use of convergence and divergence apply in a variety of different settings, such as functions, sequences, 
and integrals, etc. Though definitions are slightly different depending on context, convergence generally tends
to mean values become closer and closer to some specified limit, and divergence tends to mean the contextual
object in question is not converging.

# Functions

Let $f$ be a function defined on some interval $(a, \infty)$. Then $$ \xlimit{x}{\infty}\;f(x) = L $$ means
that for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is a corresponding number $N$ such that if $x > N$ then $|\;f(x)-L| < \epsilon$.
We say this function **converges**. 

Similarly, $$ \xlimit{x}{\infty}\;f(x)=\infty $$ means that for every positive number $M$ there is a corresponding 
positive number $N$ such that if $x > N$ then $f(x) > M$. We say this function **diverges**.

# Sequences and Series

There are many types of sequences and series, and their convergence (or lack thereof) can be determined in a variety of
ways. For example, given a geometric sequence, we can determine its convergence by the ratio being exponentiated. More
precisely:

The sequence $\{r^n\}$ is convergent if $-1 < r \leq 1$ and divergent for all other values of $r$:
$$
  \xlimit{n}{\infty} r^n = \begin{cases}
    0 &\text{ if } -1 < r < 1 \\
    1 &\text{ if } r = 1
  \end{cases}
$$

Other sequence and series convergence/divergence concepts are discussed under [series](series).
