# Summary

Let $m$ and $n$ be [relatively prime](greatest_common_divisor#prime-relativity) positive integers, and let $a$ and $b$ be integers 
where $0 \leq a \leq m - 1$ and $0 \leq b \leq n - 1$. Then there is a positive integer $x$ such that the remainder when $x$ 
is divided by $m$ is $a$ and the remainder when $x$ is divided by $n$ is $b$; that is, $x$ can be written in the form 
$x = pm + a$ and also in the form $x = qn + b$ for some integers $p$ and $q$.

<div class="proof">

Consider the $n$ integers $$ a, m + a, 2m + a, \ldots, (n - 1)m + a. $$ Note that each of these integers has remainder $a$ when
divided by $m$. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that two of them had the same remainder $r$ when divided by $n$. Let the 
two numbers be $im + a$ and $jm + a$, where $0 \leq i < j \leq n - 1$. Then there are integers $q_i$ and $q_j$ such that
$$ im + a = q_in + r \quad\text{ and }\quad jm + a = q_jn + r. $$ Subtracting these equations yield $$ (j - i)m = (q_j - q_i)n. $$
Therefore $n$ must be a factor of the number $(j - i)m$; by prime relativity, we note $n$ must be a factor of $j - i$. However,
$0 \leq i < j \leq n - 1$ implies that $0 < j - i \leq n - 1$, and hence $n$ cannot be a factor of $j - 1$. 

This contradiction leads to the conclusion that the original $n$ integers must each actually have a different remainder when 
divided by $n$. By the [pigeonhole principle](pigeonhole_principle), each of the $n$ numbers $0, 1, \ldots, n-1$ occurs as a
remainder, meaning the number $b$ must as well. Let $p$ be the integer with $0 \leq p \leq n-1$ such that the number
$x = pm + a$ has remainder $b$ when divided by $n$. Then, for some integer $q$, $x = qn + b$. Therefore $x = pm + a$
and $x = qn + b$, meaning $x$ has the required properties.
