![Simple Bounded Region](/img/diagrams/calculus/greens-theorem.png)

Green's Theorem gives a relationship between a line integral around a simple closed curve $C$ and the double integral
over the plane region $D$ bounded by $C$. Note that we follow the convention of positive orientation of a simple closed
curve referring to a counterclockwise traversal of $C$; in this way, the region bounded is always on the left of the curve
while traversed. Now, this relationship is as follows:

Let $C$ be a positively oriented, piecewise-smooth, simple closed curve in the plane and let $D$ be the region bounded
by $C$. If $P$ and $Q$ have continuous partial derivatives on an open region that contains $D$, then
$$ \int_C P\;dx + Q\;dy = \iint_D \left(\pleibniz[Q]{x} - \pleibniz[P]{y}\right)\;dA. $$

Note the similarity between the above and part II of the 
[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](fundamental_theorem_of_calculus#integrals-part-two). In both cases, there is an integral
involving derivatives on one side and values of the original functions on the boundary of the domain on the other.

<div class="proof">

Though not easy to prove in general, Green's Theorem is relatively simple to apply to simple regions 
(of both type I and type II: e.g. a circle), which could resemble the diagram pictured above. More general regions can 
then be broken into simple regions, with the understanding that any dividing segments are positive for one subregion, and 
negative for the other, negating one another for a collective sum of the just the double integral over the intended region.

Notice that, for a simple region, Green's Theorem will be proved if we can show that
$$ \int_C P\;dx = -\iint_D \pleibniz[P]{y}\;dA \quad(1)$$
and
$$ \int_C Q\;dy = \iint_D \pleibniz[Q]{x}\;dA. \quad(2)$$

We first prove equation $(1)$ by expressing $D$ as a type I region:
$$ D = \left\{ (x, y) : a \leq x \leq b, g_1(x) \leq y \leq g_2(x) \right\} $$
where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are continuous functions. This enables us to compute the double integral on the right side of equation
$(1)$ as follows:
$$ 
  \iint_D \pleibniz[P]{y}\;dA 
    = \int_a^b \int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} \pleibniz[P]{y}(x, y)\;dy\;dx 
    = \int_a^b \left[P(x, g_2(x)) - P(x, g_1(x))\right]\;dx
$$
where the last step follows from the [Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](fundamental_theorem_of_calculus). Next we compute the
left side of $(1)$ by breaking up $C$ as the union of the four curves $C_1, C_2, C_3$ and $C_4$ shown in the diagram. On 
$C_1$ we take $x$ as the parameter and write the parametric equations as $x = x, y = g_1(x), a \leq x \leq b$. Thus
$$ \int_{C_1} P(x, y)\;dx = \int_a^b P(x, g_1(x))\;dx. $$
Similarly
$$ \int_{C_3} P(x, y)\;dx = -\int_{-C_3} P(x, y)\;dx = -\int_a^b P(x, g_2(x))\;dx. $$
On $C_2$ or $C_4$, $x$ is constant, so $dx = 0$ and
$$ \int_{C_2} P(x, y)\;dx = 0 = \int_{C_4} P(x, y)\;dx. $$
Hence
$$\begin{align*}
  \int_C P(x, y)\;dx &= \int_{C_1} P(x, y)\;dx + \int_{C_2} P(x, y)\;dx + \int_{C_3} P(x, y)\;dx + \int_{C_4} P(x, y)\;dx \\
                     &= \int_a^b P(x, g_1(x))\;dx - \int_a^b P(x, g_2(x))\;dx.
\end{align*}$$
Comparing this equation with the one found when evaluating the right hand side of $(1)$, we see that
$$ \int_C P(x, y)\;dx = -\iint_D \pleibniz[P]{y}\;dA. $$
Equation $(2)$ can be proven similarly, by expressing $D$ as type II region. Adding gives us our desired equality.

# Curl Form

We can express the line integral of the tangential component of a vector field $\pmb{F}$ along $C$ as the double integral
of the vertical component of $\text{curl}\;\pmb{F}$ over the region $D$ enclosed by $C$. That is,
$$ \oint_C \pmb{F}\cdot d\pmb{r} = \iint_D (\text{curl}\;\pmb{F}) \cdot \pmb{k}\;dA. $$

<div class="proof">

Suppose that the plane region $D$ with boundary curve $C$ and functions $P$ and $Q$ satisfy the hypotheses of
[Green's Theorem](#summary) stated above. Then we consider the vector field $\pmb{F} = P\pmb{i} + Q\pmb{j}$. Its
line integral is
$$ \oint_C \pmb{F} \cdot d\pmb{r} = \oint_C P\;dx + Q\;dy $$
and, regarding $\pmb{F}$ as a vector field on $\bbr^3$ with third component $0$, we have
$$ 
  \text{curl}\;\pmb{F} 
    = \left|\begin{array}{ccc}
        \pmb{i}      & \pmb{j}      & \pmb{k}      \\
        \pleibniz{x} & \pleibniz{y} & \pleibniz{z} \\
        P(x, y)      & Q(x, y)      & 0
      \end{array}\right|
    = \left(\pleibniz[Q]{x} - \pleibniz[P]{y}\right)\pmb{k}.
$$
Therefore
$$ 
  (\text{curl}\;\pmb{F}) \cdot \pmb{k} 
    = \left( \pleibniz[Q]{x} - \pleibniz[P]{y}\right)\pmb{k} \cdot \pmb{k}
    = \pleibniz[Q]{x} - \pleibniz[P]{y}
$$
and we can now rewrite the equation in Green's Theorem in vector form as
$$ \oint_C \pmb{F}\cdot d\pmb{r} = \iint_D (\text{curl}\;\pmb{F}) \cdot \pmb{k}\;dA. $$

# Divergence Form

<div class="block">

![Divergence Outward](/img/diagrams/calculus/greens-divergence.png)

We can express the line integral of the normal component of $\pmb{F}$ along $C$ as the double integral
of the divergence of $\pmb{F}$ over the region $D$ enclosed by $C$. That is,
$$ \oint_C \pmb{F} \cdot \pmb{n}\;ds = \iint_D \text{div}\;\pmb{F}(x, y)\;dA. $$
More intuitively, we note that $\pmb{F} \cdot \pmb{n}$ is the amount of "flow" pointing along $\pmb{n}$.
So the above line integral is the amount of total flow summed at each point along the curve. It is an 
expression of the total divergence of the curve.

</div>

<div class="proof">

Suppose $C$ is given by the vector equation
$$ \pmb{r}(t) = x(t)\pmb{i} + y(t)\pmb{j}, \quad a \leq t \leq b, $$
then the [unit tangent vector](tnb_frames) is
$$ \pmb{T}(t) = \frac{x'(t)}{\norm{\pmb{r}'(t)}}\pmb{i} + \frac{y'(t)}{\norm{\pmb{r}'(t)}}\pmb{j}. $$
Then, by reciprocals, we find that the outward unit normal vector to $C$ is given by
$$ \pmb{n}(t) = \frac{y'(t)}{\norm{\pmb{r}'(t)}}\pmb{i} - \frac{x'(t)}{\norm{\pmb{r}'(t)}}\pmb{j}. $$
Therefore
$$\begin{align*}
  \oint_C \pmb{F} \cdot \pmb{n}\;ds 
    &= \int_a^b (\pmb{F}\cdot\pmb{n})(t)\norm{\pmb{r}'(t)}\;dt                     \\
    &= \int_a^b \left[\frac{P(x(t), y(t))y'(t)}{\norm{\pmb{r}'(t)}}
     - \frac{Q(x(t), y(t))x'(t)}{\norm{\pmb{r}'(t)}}\right] \norm{\pmb{r}'(t)}\;dt \\
    &= \int_a^b P(x(t), y(t))y'(t)\;dt - Q(x(t), y(t))x'(t)\;dt                    \\
    &= \int_C P\;dy - Q\;dx 
     = \iint_D \left(\pleibniz[P]{x} + \pleibniz[Q]{y}\right)\;dA
\end{align*}$$
