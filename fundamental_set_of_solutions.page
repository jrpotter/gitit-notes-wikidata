# Summary

Suppose that $y_1$ and $y_2$ are two solutions of the differential equation $$ L[y] = y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = 0. $$
Then the family of solutions $$ y = c_1y_1(t) + c_2y_2(t) $$ with arbitrary coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$ includes every
solution of $L[y]$ if and only if there is a point $t_0$ where the Wronskian of $y_1$ and $y_2$ is not zero. We say
the solutions $y_1$ and $y_2$ form a **fundamental set of solutions** if and only if their [Wronskian](wronskian) is nonzero.

<div class="proof">

$\forward$ We proceed by contraposition. That is, suppose there is no point $t_0$ where the Wronskian is nonzero. 
Then there are values of $y_0$ and $y_0'$ such that the system
$$\begin{align*}
  c_1y_1(t_0) + c_2y_2(t_0) &= y_0     \\
  c_1y_1'(t_0) + c_2y_2'(t_0) &= y_0'.
\end{align*}$$
has no solution for $c_1$ and $c_2$. If we were to select such values, then, by 
[existence](homogeneous_equations#existence-and-uniqueness), there is some solution $\phi(t)$ that satisfies the initial
conditions. However this solution cannot be in the family $y = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$. Thus the linear combination does not
include all solutions of $L[y]$ if the Wronskian is $0$.

$\backward$ Let $\phi$ be any solution of $L[y]$. We must then determine whether there exist values of the constants $c_1$ and 
$c_2$ that make the linear combination the same as $\phi$. By hypothesis, there exists a point $t_0$ where the Wronskian of 
$y_1$ and $y_2$ is not zero. Let $y_0 = \phi(t_0)$ and $y_0' = \phi'(t_0)$. Now consider initial value problem
$$ y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = 0, \quad y(t_0) = y_0, \quad y'(t_0) = y_0', $$
of which $\phi$ is a solution by construction. Since the Wronskian is nonzero, then the matrix must be invertible and
$c_1$ and $c_2$ can be picked so that $y = c_1y_1(t) + c_2y_2(t)$ is a solution. Furthermore, by 
[uniqueness](homogeneous_equations#existence-and-uniqueness), any two solutions to the same initial value problem must
be the same function. Thus $\phi$ is included in the family of functions $c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$.
