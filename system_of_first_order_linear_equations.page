A system of first order linear equations is incredibly important in practice since an arbitrary $\spscript{n}{th}$ order 
equation can be converted to an equivalent first order linear system. That is, given an $\spscript{n}{th}$ order equation 
$y^{(n)} = F(t, y, y', \ldots, y^{(n-1)})$, we can create a system of $n$ first order equations by introducing variables
$\inflate{x}{n}$ defined by $$ x_1 = y, \; x_2 = y', \; x_3 = y'', \; \ldots, \; x_n = y^{(n-1)}. $$
We can generalize this further by constructing the system
$$\begin{align*}
  x_1' &= F_1(t, \inflate{x}{n}), \\
  x_2' &= F_2(t, \inflate{x}{n}), \\
       &\;\vdots                  \\
  x_n' &= F_n(t, \inflate{x}{n})
\end{align*}$$
which can be shown to be have a unique solution satisfying some set of initial values.

# Existence and Uniqueness

If each of the functions $\inflate{F}{n}$ is a linear function of the dependent variables $\inflate{x}{n}$, we say the system
of equations is **linear**. The most general system of of $n$ first order linear equations 
$$\begin{align*}
  x_1' &= p_{11}(t)x_1 + \cdots + p_{1n}(t)x_n + g_1(t), \\
  x_2' &= p_{21}(t)x_1 + \cdots + p_{2n}(t)x_n + g_2(t), \\
       &\;\vdots                                         \\
  x_n' &= p_{n1}(t)x_1 + \cdots + p_{nn}(t)x_n + g_n(t).
\end{align*}$$
If the functions $p_{11}, p_{12}, \ldots, p_{nn}, \inflate{g}{n}$ are
continuous on an open interval $I: \alpha < t < \beta$, then there exists a unique solution $x_1 = \phi_1(t), \;\ldots,
\;x_n = \phi_n(t)$ of the above system that also satisfies the initial conditions
$$ x_1(t_0) = x_1^0, x_2(t_0) = x_2^0, \ldots, x_n(t_0) = x_n^0, $$
where $t_0$ is any point in $I$ and $\inflate{x^0}{n}$ are any prescribed numbers. Moreover, the solution exists throughout
the interval $I$.
