![Rolle's Theorem on Quadratic](/img/graphs/calculus/rolles-theorem.png)

Let $f$ be a function satisfying:

1. $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$.
2. $f$ is differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$.
3. $f(a) = f(b)$.

Then there is a number $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

We note the above implies the [Mean Value Theorem](mean_value_theorem) if a rotation exists
that would enable us to view the given function so that $f(a) = f(b)$. By clever subtractions,
we can always ensure this is true.

<div class="proof">   

Consider the following cases:

- *Case 1*: Suppose $f(x) = k$, a constant.  
  Then $f'(x) = 0$, and $c$ can be any number in $(a, b)$.

- *Case 2*: Suppose $f(x) > f(a)$ for some $x \in (a, b)$.  
  Then by the [Extreme Value Theorem](extreme_value_theorem), $f$ has a maximum value in $[a, b]$. 
  Since $f(a)=f(b)$, it must attain this maximum at a number $c \in (a, b)$.  
  Thus, by [Fermat's Theorem](fermats_theorem), $\;f'(c) = 0$.

- *Case 3*: Suppose $f(x) < f(a)$ for some $x \in (a, b)$.  
  By a similar argument as in Case 2, $\;f'(c) = 0$ for some $c \in (a, b)$.

These cases are exhaustive, completing the proof.
