# Statement

<div class="block">

![](/img/graphs/calculus/fermats-theorem.png)

If $f$ has a local maximum or minimum at $c$, and if $f'(c)$ exists, then $f'(c) = 0$.

Note this states that at a local minimum or maximum, the tangent line is horizontal. These points are
called [critical numbers](critical_numbers) and denotes where the derivatives change from positive to
negative or negative to positive[^1].

Note Fermat's Theorem can be generalized to other curves. In particular, consider [vector functions](vector_functions)
which can be considered a component at a time (the projection on the respective standard planes are plane curves).
Thus one can find where the curve has a "bend" away and towards the origin or towards and then away from the origin[^2].

<div class="proof">

Suppose $f$ has a local maximum at $c$. Then $f(c) \geq f(x)$ for all $x$ sufficiently close to $c$. 
Then $f(x)\geq f(c+h)$ for some $h$ sufficiently close to $c$, implying $f(c+h)-f(c)\leq 0$. Thus 
$$ \xlimit[+]{h}{0} \frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h} \leq \xlimit[+]{h}{0} 0 = 0 $$ 
and 
$$ \xlimit[-]{h}{0} \frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h} \geq \xlimit[-]{h}{0} 0 = 0. $$ 
Therefore $f'(c)=0$; a similar proof holds for local minimums.

# Generalization

Let $f$ be a function of two variables. Then if $f$ has a local maximum or minimum at $(a, b)$ and the first
order partial derivatives of $f$ exist there, then $f_x(a, b) = 0$ and $f_y(a, b) = 0$.

<div class="proof">

Let $g(x) = f(x, b)$. If $f$ has a local maximum (or minimum) at $(a, b)$, then $g$ has a local maximum
(or minimum) at $a$, so $g'(a) = 0$ by Fermat's Theorem. But $g'(a) = f_x(a, b)$ and so $f_x(a, b) = 0$.
Similarly, by applying Fermat's Theorem to the function $G(y) = f_(a, y)$, we obtain $f_y(a, b) = 0$.
