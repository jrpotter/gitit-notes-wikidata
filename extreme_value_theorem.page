# Statement

<div class="block">

![](/img/graphs/calculus/extreme-value-theorem.png)

If $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$, then $f$ attains an absolute maximum value $f(c)$ and an 
absolute minimum value $f(d)$ for $c,d \in [a, b]$. That is, there exist numbers $c$ and $d$ in $[a, b]$ such that
$$ f(c) \geq f(x) \geq f(d) \text{ for all } x \in [a, b]\text{.} $$

Note this is a relatively intuitive statement, but the proof is fairly difficult so is omitted. Nonetheless,
this theorem is incredibly important; for example, it is a fundamental component of the proof of the
[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](fundamental_theorem_of_calculus).

# Generalization

If $f$ is continuous on a closed, bounded set $D$ in $\bbr^2$, then $\;f$ attains an absolute maximum value
$f(x_1, y_1)$ and an absolute minimum value $\;f(x_2, y_2)$ at some points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in $D$.

Given the above, the general procedure in finding an absolute maximum and minimum of a continuous function $\;f$ on
a closed, bounded set $D$ is to first find the values of $\;f$ at the critical points of $\;f$ in $D$, then find
the extreme values of $\;f$ on the boundary of $D$, and lastly pick the largest and smallest of the collective values.
