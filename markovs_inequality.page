# Summary

Suppose $X$ is a random variable that takes only nonnegative values. Then for any value $a > 0$,
$$ \bbps{X \geq a} \leq \frac{E[X]}{a}. $$
This allows us to determine bounds on any nonnegative random variables of which only the mean is known.

<div class="proof">

For $a > 0$, define the [indicator variable](indicator_variables)
$$ I = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{if } X \geq a \\ 0 &\text{otherwise}. \end{cases} $$
Note that this implies $$ I \leq \frac{X}{a}. $$ Therefore, by taking expectations, we
get that $$ E[I] \leq \frac{E[X]}{a}, $$ proving our result.
