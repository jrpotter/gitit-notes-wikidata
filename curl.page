Intuitively, **curl** is a measure of the rotation applied on an object at any point in a vector field.
That is, if a vector field has a vector at any point parallel to any other, we would expect an object
placed here to *flow* along the direction of the vectors, but not rotate around any axis. Alternatively,
if the vectors in the field do not have this parallel property, we'd expect the object to rotate while
still moving along with the general flow of the field. With this notion in mind, we can consider the
curl to be a measure of this rotation. 

To motivate the idea further, we can observe the diagram to the right, in which we want to find that the velocity field
of $B$ is given by $\pmb{v} = \pmb{w} \times \pmb{r}$. Let the rotation be described by the vector $\pmb{w} = \omega\pmb{k}$,
where $\omega$ is the angular speed of $B$, that is, the tangential speed of any point $P$ in $B$ divided by the distance $d$
from the axis of rotation. Furthermore, let $\pmb{r} = \lrangle{x, y, z}$ be the position vector of $P$. Then, denoting the 
tangential vector as $\pmb{v}$, 
$$ \omega = \norm{\pmb{w}} = \frac{\pmb{v}}{d} = \frac{\pmb{v}}{\sin{\theta}\norm{\pmb{r}}} $$
meaning
$$ \pmb{v} = \norm{\pmb{w}}\norm{\pmb{r}}\sin{\theta} = \pmb{w} \times \pmb{r}. $$

With this complete, we can now explicitly define curl. If $\pmb{F} = P\pmb{i} + Q\pmb{j} + R\pmb{k}$ is a vector field
on $\bbr^3$ and the partial derivatives of $P$, $Q$, and $R$ all exist, then the curl of $\pmb{F}$ is the vector field
on $\bbr^3$ defined by 
$$ 
  \text{curl}\;\pmb{F} = \left(\pleibniz[R]{y} - \pleibniz[Q]{z}\right)\pmb{i} 
                       + \left(\pleibniz[P]{z} - \pleibniz[R]{x}\right)\pmb{j}
                       + \left(\pleibniz[Q]{x} - \pleibniz[P]{y}\right)\pmb{k}
$$
which can be expressed notationally as
$$ \text{curl}\;F = \nabla \times \pmb{F}. $$

# Gradient Field

If $f$ is a function of three variables that has continuous second-order partial derivatives, then
$$ \text{curl}(\nabla f) = \pmb{0}. $$
That is, the curl of a gradient vector field is always $\pmb{0}$. Intuitively, since the gradient always points in the
direction of maximum increase, it makes sense that this field does not have any concept of rotation along it.

<div class="proof">

$$
  \text{curl}(\nabla f) 
    = \nabla \times (\nabla f) = \left|\begin{array}{ccc}
        \pmb{i}         & \pmb{j}         & \pmb{k}         \\
        \pleibniz{x}    & \pleibniz{y}    & \pleibniz{z}    \\
        \pleibniz[f]{x} & \pleibniz[f]{y} & \pleibniz[f]{z}
      \end{array}\right|      
$$
so
$$
  \text{curl}(\nabla f)
    = \left(\pleibniz[^2f]{y\partial z} - \pleibniz[^2f]{z\partial y}\right)\pmb{i}
    + \left(\pleibniz[^2f]{z\partial x} - \pleibniz[^2f]{x\partial z}\right)\pmb{j}
    + \left(\pleibniz[^2f]{x\partial y} - \pleibniz[^2f]{y\partial x}\right)\pmb{k}
$$
which is indeed $\pmb{0}$ by [Clairaut's Theorem](clairauts_theorem).
