![Rotated Rolle's Theorem](/img/graphs/calculus/mean-value-theorem.png)

Let $f$ be a function that satisfies:

1. $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$.
2. $f$ is differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$.

Then there is a number $c \in (a, b)$ such that 
$$f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}, $$ 
or, equivalently,
$$ f(b)-f(a) = f'(c)(b-a). $$

<div class="proof">

Let $A = (a, \;f(a))$ and $B = (b, \;f(b))$ be points on $f$. Define $h$ to be the difference between $f$ and the 
secant line $AB$, which is $$ y - f(a) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}(x-a). $$ 
Thus $h(x) = f(x)-f(a)-\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}(x-a)$. We note $h$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$. 
We also note 
$$ h(a) = f(a)-f(a)-\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}(a-a) = 0 $$ 
and
$$\begin{align*}
  h(b) &= f(b)-f(a)-\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}(b-a) \\
       &= f(b)-f(a)-[f(b)-f(a)]                \\
       &= 0
\end{align*}$$
meaning $h(a)=h(b)$. Therefore, by [Rolle's Theorem](rolles_theorem), 
$$ 0 = h'(c) = f'(c) -\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$ so $$f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}. $$

# Cauchy's Theorem

The Mean Value Theorem can be generalized even further, as such:

Suppose that the functions $f$ and $g$ are continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$, and $g'(x) \neq 0$ 
for all $x \in (a, b)$. Then there is a number $c \in (a, b)$ such that 
$$ \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}. $$

<div class="proof">

Let $A = (g(a), \;f(a)), B = (g(b), \;f(b))$ and $$ AB = f(a) + \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}[g(x)-g(a)]. $$
This gives $$ h(x) = f(x)-f(a)-\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}[g(x)-g(a)] $$ and the rest follows in an argument similar
to the original [Mean Value Theorem](#summary).

# Integral Variation

If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then there exists a number $c$ in $[a, b]$ such that
$$ f(c) = f_{\text{ave}} = \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x)dx\text{,} $$ that is, 
$$ \int_a^b f(x)dx = f(c)(b-a)\text{.} $$

<div class="proof">  

Let $f$ be continuous on an interval $[a, b]$, and define $F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)dt$. By the
[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](fundamental_theorem_of_calculus), we note $F(x)$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, 
differentiable on $a, b$, and $F'(x) = f(x)$. Since $F$ is continuous on the given interval, by the 
[Mean Value Theorem](#statement) there exists a $c \in (a, b)$ such that $F(b) - F(a) = F'(c)(b - a)$. This implies:
$$\begin{align*}
  & \qquad F(b) - F(a) = F'(c)(b - a)                        \\
  &\Rightarrow \int_a^b f(t)dt - \int_a^a f(t)dt = f(c)(b-a) \\
  &\Rightarrow \int_a^b f(t)dt = f(c)(b-a)
\end{align*}$$
completing the proof.
