# Summary

A **multiset** is an abstraction of a set that keeps track of the number of each element in the set. That is
repetition is allowed. More precisely, consider distinct elements $\inflate{a}{k}$ with repetition numbers
$\inflate{n}{k}$, where each $n_i$ is nonnegative for $i = 1, \ldots, k$. Then the multiset containing these elements is
$$ \{ n_1 \cdot a_1, n_2 \cdot a_2, \cdots, n_k \cdot a_k \}. $$
As an aside, zero or more of the elements $\inflate{a}{k}$ could have repetition number $\infty$.

# Permutations

If $S$ is a multiset, an **$r$-permutation** of $S$ is an ordered arrangement of $r$ of the objects of $S$.
If the total number of objects of $S$ is $n$, including repetitions, then an $n$-permutation of $S$ is also
called a **permutation of $S$**.

## Infinite Repetition

Let $S$ be a multiset with objects of $k$ different types, where each object has an infinite repetition number.
Then the number of $r$-permutations of $S$ is $k^r$.

<div class="proof">

When constructing an $r$-permutation, we can choose each item to be any one of the $k$ items. Thus there are
$k$ possible selections for $r$ spots meaning there exist $k^r$ permutations.

## Finite Repetition

Let $S$ be a multiset with objects of $k$ different types with finite repetition numbers $\inflate{n}{k}$
respectively. Let the size of $S$ be $n = \inflatec[+]{n}{k}$. Then the number of permutations of $S$ equals
$$ \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\cdots n_k!}. $$

<div class="proof">

We are given a multiset $S$ having objects of $k$ types, say $\inflate{a}{k}$ with repetition numbers
$\inflate{n}{k}$ respectively, for a total of $n = \inflatec[+]{n}{k}$ objects. Then there are $n$ places
for the first $n_1$ objects, $n - n_1$ places for the next $n_2$ objects, etc. Therefore the number of permutations
of $S$ equals $$ \binom{n}{n_1}\binom{n-n_1}{n_2}\binom{n-n_1-n_2}{n_3}\cdots\binom{n-\inflatec[-]{n}{k-1}}{n_k}. $$
Simplifying, we find that the above equals $$ \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\cdots n_k!}. $$

# Combinations

If $S$ is a multiset, then an **$r$-combination** of $S$ is an unordered selection of $r$ of the objects of $S$. Thus, an
$r$-combination of $S$ is itself a multiset, a **submultiset** of $S$ of size $r$.

<section class="secondary">

## Infinite Repetition

Let $S$ be a multiset with objects of $k$ types, each with an infinite repetition number. Then the number of 
$r$-combinations of $S$ equals $$ \binom{r+k-1}{r}. $$

<div class="proof">

Let the $k$ types of objects of $S$ be $\inflate{a}{k}$ so that
$$ S = \{ \infty \cdot a_1, \infty \cdot a_2, \ldots, \infty \cdot a_k \}. $$
Any $r$-combination of $S$ is of the form $\{x_1\cdot a_1, x_2\cdot a_2, \ldots, x_k\cdot a_k\}$, where $\inflate{x}{k}$
are nonnegative integers and $\inflatec[+]{x}{k} = r$. We also note that every sequence $\inflate{x}{k}$ of nonnegative
integers with $\inflatec[+]{x}{k} = r$ corresponds to an $r$-combination of $S$. Thus we want to find the number of
solutions of the equation $$ \inflatec[+]{x}{k} = r. $$

It can be shown that the number of solutions is the same as the number of permutations of the multiset
$$ T = \{ r \cdot 1, (k-1) \cdot 0 \}, $$ that is, the set of binary strings constructed from the multiset.
Any permutation of $T$ has the $r$ $1$s divided into $k$ groups by the $k - 1$ $0$s. Let 
$x_i$ for $i = 1, \ldots, k-1$ denote the number of $1$s to the left of the $\spscript{i}{th}\;0$ and let
$x_k$ denote the number of $1$s to the right of the last $0$. Then $\inflate{x}{k}$ are nonnegative integers
with $\inflatec[+]{x}{k} = r$. Conversely, given a binary sequence such that the number of $1$s is $r$ and
the number of $0$s is $k - 1$, we can construct a permutation of $T$. Thus, the number of $r$-combinations of the
multiset $S$ equals the number of permutations of the multiset $T$, which is
$$ \frac{(r+k-1)!}{r!(k-1)!} = \binom{r+k-1}{r}. $$
