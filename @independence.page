# Buffon's Needle Problem

<div class="block">

![Buffon Needle Diagram](/img/diagrams/statistics/buffon-needle.png)

Suppose a table is ruled with equidistant parallel lines a distance $D$ apart. A needle of length
$L$ where $L \leq D$, is randomly thrown on the table. Then the probability that the needle will
intersect one of the lines is
$$ \frac{2L}{\pi D}. $$
Note that this method, via a Markov process, can actually be used to find the value of $\pi$!

<div class="proof">

Let $X$ be the random variable representing the middle point of the needle to the nearest parallel line and $\theta$ be the 
random variable representing the angle between the needle and the projected line of length $X$. The needle will intersect a 
line if the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the projected line and the needle is less than $L/2$. Therefore
$$ \frac{X}{\cos{\theta}} < \frac{L}{2} \text{ or } X < \frac{L}{2}\cos{\theta}. $$
As $X$ varies between $0$ and $D/2$ and $\theta$ between $0$ and $\pi/2$, it is reasonable to assume that they are independent,
uniformly distributed random variables over their respective ranges. Hence,
$$\begin{align*}
  \bbps{X < \frac{L}{2}\cos{\theta}} 
    &= \iint_{x < L/2\cos{y}} f_X(x)f_{\theta}(y)\;dx\;dy                                \\
    &= \iint_{x < L/2\cos{y}} \left(\frac{2}{D}\right)\left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)\;dx\;dy \\
    &= \frac{4}{\pi D} \int_0^{\pi/2} \int_0^{L/2\cos{y}}\;dx\;dy                        \\
    &= \frac{4}{\pi D} \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{L}{2} \cos{y}\;dy                            \\
    &= \frac{2L}{\pi D}.
\end{align*}$$
