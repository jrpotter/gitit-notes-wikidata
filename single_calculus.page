# Summary

<div class="block excerpt">

![Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz](/img/portraits/leibniz.jpg)

Single-Variable Calculus refers to the subject focused on analyzing the change of a function of a single variable
with respect to some limiting factor. For example, when exploring derivatives, the limiting factor is the slope of
the approximate line at a given point and, in regards to integrals, we refer to the approximate area of the function
under a given curve. It also serves as the foundation of continuous math; even when exploring higher order functions,
we are generally concerned with just continuous ones (or at least those with only a finite number of discontinuities).

It is important to note that many concepts of [Multi-Variable Calculus](multi_calculus) apply to that of Single
Variable Calculus if the dimensions following the first two are set to $0$. For example, [curvature](/MC/curvature)
is a concept that helps explain the change in a curve of a function in vector space, but the same concept can be extended
to plane curves by not regarding the $z$ dimension. Other higher ordered concepts of those in Single Variable Calculus
also decompose to their lower order counterparts (e.g. [line integrals](/MC/line_integrals), 
[parametric surfaces](/MC/parametric_surfaces), etc.).

Leibniz (pictured right) and Newton are often accredited with the development of Calculus independently, though Leibniz's 
notation, which was much more convenient and well thought out, is primarily used today.
