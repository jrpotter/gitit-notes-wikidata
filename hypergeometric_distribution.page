# Summary

<div class="block">

![Hypergeometric PDFs](/img/graphs/statistics/hypergeometric-pdf.png)

Suppose that a sample of size $n$ is to be chosen randomly (without replacement) from an urn containing $N$ balls,
of which $m$ are white and $N-m$ are black. If we let $X$ denote the number of white balls selected, then

$$ \bbps{X=i} = \frac{\binom{m}{i}\binom{N-m}{n-i}}{\binom{N}{n}},\quad i=0,1,\ldots,n. $$

A random variable $X$ whose probability mass function is given by the above for some values of $n, N, m$ is said to
be a **hypergeometric** random variable.

# Expectation

The expected value of a hypergeometric random variable $X$ with parameters $(n, N, m)$ is 
$$ E[X] = \frac{nm}{N}. $$

# Variance

The variance of a hypergeometric random variable $X$ with parameters $(n, N, m)$ is
$$ \text{Var}(X) = np(1-p)\left(1 - \frac{n-1}{N-1}\right). $$

# Binomial Approximation

The expectation of a hypergeometric random variable is approximately $np$ when the selection of the balls is done with 
replacement (since this is the number of white balls binomial with parameters $n$ and $p$. In addition if $N$ is large 
in relation to $n$ (so that $(N - n)/(N - 1)$ is approximately equal to $1$), then
$$ \text{Var}(X) \approx np(1 - p). $$
Therefore the number of while balls chosen approximately has the same mass function of a binomial random variable.
