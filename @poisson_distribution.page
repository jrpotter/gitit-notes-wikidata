# Generalized Birthday Problem

<div class="block">

![Birthday Problem](/img/graphs/statistics/birthday_problem.png)

We've seen how to solve the [birthday problem](axioms_of_probability#birthday-problem) for the case of $2$ people,
but how do we generalize this to $3$? By using the [Poisson Paradigm](/ST/poisson_distribution#summary), we find that 
the approximate probability that at least $3$ people in a group of size $84$ or larger will have the same birthday
exceeds $\frac{1}{2}$.

<div class="proof">

Imagine that we have a trial for each of the $\binom{n}{3}$ triples $i, j, k$, where $1 \leq i < j < k \leq n$,
and call the $i, j, k$ trial a success if persons $i, j,$ and $k$ all have their birthday on the same day. Then
the number of successes is approximately a Poisson random variable with parameter
$$\begin{align*}
  \binom{n}{3}\bbps{i,j,k \text{ have the same birthday}} &= \binom{n}{3}\left(\frac{1}{365}\right)^2 \\
                                                          &= \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6 \times (365)^2}.
\end{align*}$$
Hence, $$ \bbps{\text{no }3\text{ have the same birthday}} \approx \exp{\frac{-n(n-1)(n-2)}{799350}}. $$
This probability will be less than $\frac{1}{2}$ when $n$ is such that
$$ n(n-1)(n-2) \geq 799350\log{2} \approx 554067.1 $$
which is equivalent to $n \geq 84$.
