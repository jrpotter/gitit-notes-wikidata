Suppose that independent trials, each having probability $p$, $0 < p < 1$, of being a success are performed until a
total of $r$ successes is accumulated. If we let $X$ equal the number of trials required, then

$$ \bbps{X=n} = \binom{n-1}{r-1}p^r(1-p)^{n-r}\quad n = r, \;r+1, \;\ldots $$

A random variable $X$ whose probability mass function is given by the above is said to be a **negative binomial** random
variable with parameters $(r, p)$. We note this follows because, in order the the $\spscript{r}{th}$ success to occur at the
$\spscript{n}{th}$ trial, there must be $r - 1$ successes in the first $n - 1$ trials and the $\spscript{n}{th}$ trial must be a success. The probability of the first event is $$ \binom{n-1}{r-1}p^{r-1}(1-p)^{n-r} $$ 
and the probability of the second is $p$; thus by independence, the distribution is established.

Note this is a [geometric distribution](geometric_distribution) with $r = 1$.

# Expectation

The expected value of a negative binomial random variable $X$ with parameters $(r, p)$ is 
$$ E[X] = \frac{r}{p}. $$

# Variance

The variance of a negative binomial random variable $X$ with parameters $(r, p)$ is 
$$ \text{Var}(X) = \frac{r(1-p)}{p^2}. $$

# Moment Generating Function

Let $X$ be a negative binomial random variable with parameters $(r, p)$. Then its moment generating function is
$$ M(t) = \left[\frac{pe^t}{1 - (1 - p)e^t}\right]^r. $$
