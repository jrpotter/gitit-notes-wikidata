Conditional probability takes into account the new probability given the information that another event
has already occurred. Note the conditional probability of an event is the same as the probability of said
event if it is [independent](independence) from the event it is being conditioned on.

More specifically, the probability of an event $E$ given the occurrence of an event $F$ where $\bbps{F} > 0$ is
$$ \bbps{E\;|\;F} = \frac{\bbps{EF}}{\bbps{F}}. $$

# Event Intersection

If events are dependent, we see by the definition of conditional probability that
$$ \bbps{\inflate[]{E}{n}} = \bbps{E_1}\bbps{E_2\;|\;E_1}\ldots\bbps{E_n\;|\;\inflate[]{E}{n-1}}. $$
