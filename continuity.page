Continuity states that a function has no "breaks" at a given point or throughout a given interval; this means a small change in 
the input yields a small change in the output. More precisely, it states that the limit of a function at a given value is the 
function evaluated at the given value.

More precisely, let $(X, d_X), (Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces. Then a map $\;f: X \rightarrow Y$ is called **continuous** if for every $p \in X$ and $\epsilon > 0$, $\exists\delta > 0$ such that $\forall q \in X$, $$ d_X(p, q) < \delta \Rightarrow d_Y(f(p), \:f(q)) < \epsilon.$$

# Uniform Continuity

Uniform continuity refers to a more stringent criteria of continuity in which one value of $\delta$ is sufficient for all $\epsilon$.
That is, for all $\epsilon > 0$, $\exists\delta > 0$ such that for all $p, q \in X$,
$$ d_X(p, q) < \delta \Rightarrow d_Y(f(p), \:f(q)) < \epsilon. $$

# Real Metric Spaces

Suppose we have two metric spaces $X, Y$ that equal $\bbr$. Then we can explicitly define continuous functions mapped from $\bbr^n$
to $\bbr^n$ in an intuitive, limit-oriented manner (though this limit definition can also be extended to arbitrary metric spaces).
For instance, a function $f: \bbr \rightarrow \bbr$ is continuous at a point $a$ of its domain if the limit of $\;f(x)$ as $x$ 
approaches $a$ through the domain of $f$ exists and is equal to $\;f(c)$. That is; $$ \xlimit{x}{a}\;f(x)=f(a). $$
A function $f$ is continuous over an interval $I$ if it is continuous at all points $a \in I$. Similarly, a function 
$f: \bbr^2 \rightarrow \bbr^2$ is called continuous at $(a, b)$ if $$ \xlimit{(x, y)}{(a, b)}\;f(x, y) = f(a, b). $$
We say $\;f$ is continuous on $D$ if $\;f$ is continuous at every point $(a, b)$ in $D$.
This concept can be generalized to functions of three or more variables in the obvious way.
