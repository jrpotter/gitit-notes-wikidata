# Summary

<div class="block">

![Bubble Sort](/img/diagrams/algorithms/bubble-sort.png)

The name of the bubble sort results from the way the sorting seems to bubble up the items being compared in a given array.
The entire array is iterated over again and again, swapping adjacent elements in place if out of order during each iteration. 
The algorithm is complete when no more swaps are needed.
