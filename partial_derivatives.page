Partial differentiation is a means of differentiating functions of two or more variables by keeping all variables
except for one constant, and then differentiating with respect to the dynamic variable. Geometrically speaking (at least
for a function of two variables), we are differentiating the projection of a curve, formed by projecting the intersection
of a surface intersected with a plane on the $xz$- or $yz$-plane. 

More specifically, if $f$ is a function of two variables, its **partial derivatives** are the functions $f_x$ and $f_y$ defined by
$$ f_x(x, y) = \pleibniz[f]{x} = \xlimit{h}{0} \frac{f(x+h, y)-f(x,y)}{h} $$
and 
$$ f_y(x, y) = \pleibniz[f]{y} = \xlimit{h}{0} \frac{f(x, y+h)-f(x,y)}{h}. $$

Generalizing further, if $u$ is a function of $n$ variables, $u = f(\inflate{x}{n})$, its partial derivative with respect to the 
$\spscript{i}{th}$ variable $x_i$ is
$$ \pleibniz[u]{x_i} = \xlimit{h}{0} \frac{f(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},x_i+h,x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n) - f(x_1,\ldots,x_i,\ldots,x_n)}{h}. $$

# Higher Order Derivatives

If $f$ is a function of two variables, then so are its partial derivatives, the so called **second partial derivatives**.
If $z = f(x, y)$ we use the following notation:

$$\begin{align*}
(f_x)_x &= f_{xx} = f_{11} = \pleibniz{x}\left(\pleibniz[f]{x}\right) = \pleibniz[^2f]{x^2} = \pleibniz[^2z]{x^2}                 \\
(f_x)_y &= f_{xy} = f_{12} = \pleibniz{y}\left(\pleibniz[f]{x}\right) = \pleibniz[^2f]{y\partial x} = \pleibniz[^2z]{y\partial x} \\
(f_y)_x &= f_{yx} = f_{21} = \pleibniz{x}\left(\pleibniz[f]{y}\right) = \pleibniz[^2f]{x\partial y} = \pleibniz[^2z]{x\partial y} \\
(f_y)_y &= f_{yy} = f_{22} = \pleibniz{y}\left(\pleibniz[f]{y}\right) = \pleibniz[^2f]{y^2} = \pleibniz[^2z]{y^2}
\end{align*}$$

This notation can be generalized in the obvious way.
