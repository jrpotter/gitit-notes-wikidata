![Sample Direct Product](/img/diagrams/abstract/direct-product.png)

Direct products enable us to construct new groups out of other groups. By considering groups as sets (i.e. using the notation 
of the Cartesian product on groups), we create another group where operations are applied component wise. That is, let 
$\inflate{G}{n}$ be groups. For $(\inflate{a}{n})$ and $(\inflate{b}{n})$ in $\prod_{i=1}^n G_i$, define 
$(\inflate{a}{n})(\inflate{b}{n})$ to be the element $(a_1b_1, a_2b_2, \cdots, a_nb_n)$. Then
$\prod_{i=1}^n G_i$ is a group, the **direct product of the groups $G_i$**, under this binary operation.
As an aside, note that the direct product of abelian groups is also abelian.

<div class="proof">

Since $a_i, b_i \in G_i$, and $G_i$ is a group, then $a_ib_i \in G_i$, meaning our direct product is properly
closed under the given binary operation. Letting $e_i$ be the identity element in $G_i$, then multiplication by
components implies $(\inflate{e}{n})$ is the identity in $\prod_{i=1}^n G_i$. An inverse of $(\inflate{a}{n})$
is given by $(a_1^{-1}, a_2^{-1}, \cdots, a_n^{-1})$, which is easily verified by multiplication of components.
Finally, associativity is proven by
$$\begin{align*}
(\inflatec{a}{n})[(\inflatec{b}{n})(\inflatec{c}{n})]
  &= (\inflatec{a}{n})(b_1c_1, b_2c_2, \cdots, b_nc_n)     \\
  &= (a_1(b_1c_1), a_2(b_2c_2), \cdots, a_n(b_nc_n))       \\
  &= ((a_1b_1)c_1, (a_2b_2)c_2, \cdots, (a_nb_n)c_n)       \\
  &= (a_1b_1, a_2b_2, \cdots, a_nb_n)(\inflatec{c}{n})     \\
  &= [(\inflatec{a}{n})(\inflatec{b}{n})](\inflatec{c}{n})
\end{align*}$$
Thus $\prod_{i=1}^n G_i$ is a group.

# Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups

An important consequence of direct products that will not be proved is the **Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated
Abelian Groups**, which states that every finitely generated abelian group $G$ is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic 
groups in the form
$$ 
  \bbz_{(p_1)^{r_1}} \times \bbz_{(p_2)^{r_2}} \times \cdots \times \bbz_{(p_n)^{r_n}} \times 
  \bbz \times \bbz \times \cdots \times \bbz, 
$$
where the $p_i$ are primes, not necessarily distinct, and the $r_i$ are positive integers. The direct product is unique
except for possible rearrangement of the factors; that is, the number of factors of $\bbz$ (i.e. the **Betti number**) is 
unique and the prime powers $(p_i)^{r_i}$ are unique. Keep in mind that the *finite* component of the term refers to the 
number of components needed to generate the group (of potentially infinite order if the Betti number is greater than $0$).

# Cyclicality

The group $\bbz_m \times \bbz_n$ is cyclic and is isomorphic to $\bbz_{mn}$ if and only if $m$ and $n$ are
relatively prime, that is, the gcd of $m$ and $n$ is $1$. Generalizing further, we see that the group
$\prod_{i=1}^n \bbz_{m_i}$ is cyclic and isomorphic to $\bbz_{m_1m_2\cdots m_n}$ if and only if the numbers
$m_i$ for $i = 1, \cdots, n$ are such that the gcd of any two of them is $1$. 

<div class="proof">

The generalized case follows logically from the case of the direct product of two groups:

$\forward$ Consider the cyclic subgroup of $\bbz_m \times \bbz_n$ generated by $(r, s)$. We see the first component
$r \in \bbz_m$ yields $0$ only after some multiple of $m$ summands and the second component $s \in \bbz_n$ yields $0$
only after some multiple of $n$ summands. For them to yield $0$ simultaneously requires the number of summands to be
a multiple of both $m$ and $n$, which will be $mn$ if and only if $\text{gcd}(m, n) = 1$. Thus $\bbz_m \times \bbz_n$
is cyclic of order $mn$, and hence isomorphic to $\bbz_{mn}$[^1] if $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.

$\backward$ Suppose that the gcd of $m$ and $n$ is $d > 1$. Then $mn/d$ is divisible by both $m$ and $n$. Consequently,
for any $(r, s)$ in $\bbz_m \times \bbz_n$, we have 
$$ (r, s)^{mn/d} = (1^r, 1^s)^{mn/d} = (1^{(mn/d)^r}, 1^{(mn/d)^s}) = (0^r, 0^s) = (0, 0). $$
Hence no element $(r, s)$ in
$\bbz_m \times \bbz_n$ can generate the entire group, so $\bbz_m \times \bbz_n$ is not cyclic and therefore not isomorphic
to $\bbz_{mn}$.

# Decomposability

We say a group $G$ is **decomposable** if it is isomorphic to a direct product of two proper nontrivial subgroups. Otherwise
we say $G$ is **indecomposable**. 

<section class="secondary">

## Prime Powers

It can be shown that the finite indecomposable abelian groups are actually the cyclic groups with order a power of a prime.

<div class="proof">

$\forward$ Let $G$ be a finite indecomposable abelian group. Then by the Fundamental Theorem for Finitely Generated 
Abelian Groups, we see that $G$ is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. But since $G$ is 
indecomposable, this direct product must consist of just one cyclic group whose order is a power of a prime number.

$\backward$ Let $p$ be a prime. Then $\bbz_{p^r}$ is indecomposable since if $\bbz_{p^r}$ were isomorphic to
$\bbz_{p^i} \times \bbz_{p^j}$, where $i + j = r$, then every element would have an order at most 
$p^{\text{max}(i, j)} < p^r$. That is, the smaller power would be "consumed" by the larger power, both of which
are smaller than the actual power, so it can't possibly generate the entire group.

</div>

## Subgroup Orders

If $m$ divides the order of a finite abelian group $G$, then $G$ has a subgroup of order $m$.

<div class="proof">

By the [Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups](#fundamental-theorem-of-finitely-generated-abelian-groups),
$$ G = \bbz_{(p_1)^{r_1}} \times \bbz_{(p_2)^{r_2}} \times \cdots \times \bbz_{(p_n)^{r_n}}, $$
for some primes $p_i$ (not necessarily distinct) and positive integers $r_i$. Since 
$(p_1)^{r_1}(p_2)^{r_2}\cdots(p_n)^{r_n}$ is the order of $G$, then $m$ must be of form 
$(p_1)^{s_1}(p_2)^{s_2}\cdots(p_n)^{s_n}$ where $0 \leq s_i \leq r_i$. Then $(p_i)^{r_i-s_i}$ generates a cyclic subgroup
of $\bbz_{(p_i)^{r_i}}$ of order[^2]
$$ 
  \abs{\lrangle{(p_i)^{r_i-s_i}}} = \frac{(p_i)^{r_i}}{\text{gcd}((p_i)^{r_i}, (p_i)^{r_i-s_i})}
                                  = \frac{(p_i)^{r_i}}{(p_i)^{r_i-s_i}}
                                  = (p_i)^{s_i}. 
$$
Therefore our desired subgroup is
$$ \lrangle{(p_1)^{r_1-s_1}} \times \lrangle{(p_1)^{r_2-s_2}} \times \cdots \times \lrangle{(p_n)^{r_n-s_n}}. $$

## Square Free Integers

If $m$ is a square free integer, that is, $m$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, then every abelian group
of order $m$ is cyclic.

<div class="proof">

Let $G$ be an abelian group of square free order $m$. Then by the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups,
$$ G \cong \bbz_{(p_1)^{r_1}} \times \bbz_{(p_2)^{r_2}} \times \cdots \times \bbz_{(p_n)^{r_n}}, $$
where $m = (p_1)^{r_1}(p_2)^{r_2}\cdots(p_n)^{r_n}$. Since $m$ is square free, we must have all $r_i = 1$ and all
$p_i$ be distinct primes. Therefore, by [cyclicality](#cyclicality), $G \cong \bbz_{p_1p_2\cdots p_n}$, a cyclic group.
