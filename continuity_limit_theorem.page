![Continuity of Functions](/img/graphs/calculus/function-addition.png)

The relationship between limits and continuity allows a similar relationship to be established between the 
[Algebraic Limit Theorem](algebraic_limit_theorem) and the Continuity Limit Theorem. If $f$ and $g$ are continuous 
at $a$ and $c$ is a constant, then the following are also continuous at $a$:

1. *Addition:* $$ f(x) + g(x). $$
2. *Scalar Multiplication:* $$ cf(x). $$
3. *Multiplication:* $$ f(x) \cdot g(x). $$
4. *Division:* $$ \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \text{ if } g(a) \neq 0. $$

<div class="proof">
 
Proof of each component is very similar to the corresponding proof in the Algebraic Limit Theorem. As such, we prove the 
first point, and omit the rest:  
Let $\;f$ and $g$ be continuous at $a$. Then 
$$ \xlimit{x}{a}\;f(x) = L_1 \text{ and } \xlimit{x}{a}\;g(x) = L_2\text{.} $$ 
for some values $L_1$ and $L_2$. Now consider 
$$ \xlimit{x}{a}\;\left[f(x)+g(x)\right]\text{.} $$
By the Algebraic Limit Theorem, 
$$ \xlimit{x}{a}\;\left[f(x)+g(x)\right] = L_1 + L_2\text{.} $$ 
Thus $f(x) + g(x)$ is continuous.

# Complex Variables

Suppose that $\;f$ and $g$ are functions, both of which are continuous at the point $z_0$. Let $\lambda$ be a complex number.
Then the functions $\;f + \lambda g$ and $\;fg$ are also continuous at the point $z_0$. Further, if $g(z_0) \neq 0$, the function
$\;f/g$ is continuous at $z_0$. Lastly, if $h$ is a function continuous at each point of some disc centered at the point
$w_0 = f(z_0)$, then the composition $h(f(z))$ is continuous at $z_0$.
