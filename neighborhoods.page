![Neighborhood around $p$](/img/diagrams/analysis/neighborhood-topology.png)

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $E \subset X$. Then for all $p, q \in X$, we say that a **neighborhood** of $p$ is 
a set $$ N_r(p) = \{ q \in X : d(p, q) < r \} $$ for $r > 0$. The point $p \in X$ is a **limit point** of $E$ in $X$ if 
every neighborhood of $p$ contains some point in $E$ different from $p$ itself. More precisely, we say that for all $r > 0$, 
$$ \left[(N_r(p) \cap E) \backslash \{p\}\right] \neq \emptyset. $$
If $p \in E$ and $p$ isn't a limit point of $E$, then we call $p$ an **isolated point**. A point $p$ belonging to $E$ is an 
**interior point** of $E$ if there exists an $r > 0$ such that $N_r(p) \subset E$.

# Open Set

Every neighborhood is an open set.

<div class="proof">

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Fix $r > 0$ and $p \in X$. We want to show that that $N_r(p)$ is open.
So consider another point $q \in N_r(p)$ and let $h = r - d(p, q) > 0$. That is, $h$ represents the distance
between the edge of our neighborhood and $q$. 

If we can show that $N_h(q) \subset N_r(p)$, then every point in our neighborhood must be an interior point,
and the neighborhood is consequently open. So let $w \in N_h(q)$. Therefore we have
$$\begin{align*}
  d(p, w) &\leq d(p, q) + d(q, w)    \\
          &< d(p, q) + [r - d(p, q)] \\
          &= r.
\end{align*}$$
Therefore $w \in N_r(p)$ and every neighborhood is an open set.

# Limit Points

If $p$ is a limit point of $E$, then every neighborhood of $p$ contains infinitely many points of $E$. Consequently, a finite
set has no limit points.

<div class="proof">

Suppose there exists a neighborhood $N$ containing point $p$ such that
$$ (N \cap E) \backslash \{p\} = \{q_1, \ldots, q_n\}, $$
a finite number of points. Suppose we let
$$ r = \frac{1}{2} \mathop{\text{min}}_{1 \leq j \leq n} d(p, q_j) > 0. $$
(As a quick remark, note that $r > 0$ since $r = 0$ only if $q_j = p$ for some $j$). Then 
$$ N_r(p) \backslash \{p\} = \emptyset, $$ which is a contradiction to the fact that $p$ is a limit point.
