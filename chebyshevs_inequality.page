# Summary

If $X$ is a random variable with finite mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, then, for any value
$k > 0$, $$ \bbps{\abs{X-\mu} \geq k} \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{k^2}. $$
This allows us to determine bounds on any random variables of which the mean and variance is known.

<div class="proof">

Note that $(X - \mu)^2$ is a nonnegative random variable. Therefore, by [Markov's Inequality](markovs_inequality),
$$ \bbps{(X - \mu)^2 \geq k^2} \leq \frac{E[(X - \mu)^2]}{k^2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{k^2}. $$
This then implies that
$$ \bbps{\abs{X - \mu} \geq k} \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{k^2}. $$
